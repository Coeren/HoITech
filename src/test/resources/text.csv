YUG_DESC;The foundations of a south Slavic state lie in the work of pan-Slavic intellectuals such as Vuk Karadjic, starting in the middle of 19th century. The ailing Austro-Hungarian Empire dissolved with the end of World War I, paving the way for the dreams of the pan-Slavic leaders to become a reality. Yugoslavia was created in 1918 as ëKingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenesí. Alexander I was crowned as the first king of the new country, pressed into the position by the Italian threats. The first constitution was adopted in 1921, cementing Serbian predominance in the new state. Tensions rose, and the Croatian Peasantís Party boycotted the parliament in Belgrade and demanded federalization. Even though some Croats were included in the government of Nikola Pasic in 1925, the tensions remained. In 1928, Stjepan Radic and two more delegates of the Croatian Peasantís Party were assassinated by a Montenegrin delegate of the Serbian Radical Party while in parliament. King Alexander I suspended the constitution and introduced a monarchical dictatorship in 1929. Integration was to be enforced from top on down, and the country was renamed as Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The renaming of the kingdom and the establishment of geographically defined administrative entities (Banats) helped little, as Serbs continued to dominate the political life. Croats took to radical measures, founding the ultra-nationalist Ustashe organization in 1929. The assassination of King Alexander I in 1934 brought the fragile country to the brink of civil war.;;;;;;;;;;X

YEM_DESC;The distance to the seat of the Caliph in Damascus (661) and later to Baghdad (762) provided Yemen with a role on the rim of the Arab world. In 822 Yemen began breaking away from the Abbaside Caliphate, declaring independence in 945. From there on the northern and southern Yemen began moving apart from each other. The reasons were partly geographical and economical - mountains and agriculture in the north, sea trade in the south. Additionally religious, strategic, and political issues played a role. In the north Shiites dominated, while Sunni controlled the south. Foreign attempts to influence Yemen were focused on the strategically more important south with Britain eventually conquering Aden in 1839. The north was left in peace for the most part until the Ottoman Empire took the coast of North Yemen in 1849 and the highlands in 1872 with approval from the British who were intent on containing French expansion on the Red Sea. After World War I and the breaking up of the Ottoman Empire, Northern Yemen declared its independence in 1918. The land was ruled by an Imam, a spiritual and secular leader in one. In 1934 the opposition called the Free Yemenis was formed who would in future become more and more radical.;;;;;;;;;;X

VIC_DESC;The history of modern France is shaped around three key events. The Paris Commune (1871), the meat grinder of Verdun (1916) and the surrender to Germany (1940). The France that entered the war in 1939 was not the France of 1914. There was no Union Sacree. Instead, the country was bitterly divided against itself. France had been polarized between right and left since Blum's popular Front government of 1934. The rallying cry of the French right was 'rather Hitler than Blum'. As the German armies marched through France, a new fear began to arise in the French right, fear of another Commune. The aging Marshal PÈtain, hero of Verdun, who was old enough to remember the Commune, was determined to ensure that it never happened again. PÈtain assumed political control wanting to save France again. The new French regime made a speedy peace with Germany and based itself around the provincial town of Vichy, after which it would be named. Roughly half the territory of France was either annexed or occupied by the victors, there were heavy reparations to be paid and the vultures were circling around France's colonial empire. The Japanese stood ready to occupy Indochina, the Italians had ambitions against Tunis, the Spanish looked to expand into Morocco and eventually the Germans would probably demand to have their colonies in central Africa back. The Axis powers and their ideological allies were a threat to France. However, an even greater threat came from France's former ally. Many of the leaders of Vichy felt that Britain had abandoned France in her hour of need. The evacuation at Dunkirk and the decision to hold back fighter squadrons for home defense left a bitter taste in the mouths of the Vichy leaders, but worse was still to come. French Equatorial Africa defected to De Gaul's British supported Free France regime. The British attacked the French fleet at Mes-el-Kebir, attempted an invasion of Dakar and occupied the French mandate of Syria. Vichy is surrounded by enemies - what can the government do?;;;;;;;;;;X

VEN_DESC;After 1830, a number of civil wars between conservatives and liberals rocked the country. In 1864, this period came to an end with the federalization of the country and the proclamation of the Estados Unidos de Venezuela (United States of Venezuela). Only the dictatorship of General Antonio Guzm n Blancos (1870 - 1887) consolidated the situation. After a few civilian presidents new military dictatorships followed. General Cipriano Castro (1899 - 1908) undertook assaults on foreign economic interests in his country, eventually leading to the blocking of Venezuelan ports by German, British, and Italian ships. In 1904, the U.S.A. mediated a settlement of the conflict. Economically the abolishment of slavery in 1854, led to a decrease in agricultural production. The breakthrough that made Venezuela one of Latin America's leading economic powers was made however when at the end of 19th century petroleum deposits were discovered allowing the industrialization of the agricultural state. Under General Juan Vicente G¢mez (1908 - 1929 and 1931 - 1935) oil production became the economic foundation of Colombia (aided by foreign capital). The country, having remained neutral during World War One, was able to reduce the state's debts and to stabilize the currency.;;;;;;;;;;X

USA_DESC;In 1900, America was not yet considered one of the world's principal leading nations and its diplomacy was of limited importance in the affairs of the Great Powers. The crucial intervention of the United States on the Allied side in 1917 changed this forever: America became one of the key players in international finance and politics and its seemingly inexhaustible resources of labor industry and raw materials dwarfed those of the battered European states. Nevertheless, Americans retreated into diplomatic isolation after the ending of hostilities and their economic pre-eminence was rudely cut short by the 1929 Wall Street Crash and the ensuing Great Depression which with its epicenter in the New York stock markets hit the USA hardest of all. President Roosevelt's 1933 'New Deal' sought to reverse the nation's deep malaise and has by 1936 achieved some success. But Roosevelt is growing ever more concerned about the threat to democracy from the resurgent fascist states of Europe and the military extremists of Japan. His problem lies in the clear unwillingness of the American public to countenance any foreign expeditions even with the best of motives. Can FDR aid Britain and France while holding his divided people together?;;;;;;;;;;X
USA_41_DESC;Few countries were less keen on entering the general European war than the United States in 1939. Two decades of isolationism had confirmed the population's broad belief that British, French, and German events were none of their business. Even the shocking Nazi successes in the summer of 1940 only stirred a minority into demanding more aid for the democratic West. President Roosevelt, eager to assist the British in their fight against Hitler, but hamstrung by his country's unwillingness to become too involved, used a number of ingenious ploys to get practical assistance such as 'Lend-Lease' to the UK. Readying for a possible American intervention in the future he began the build-up of the United States' modest and poorly equipped military forces. Throughout 1941 tensions in the North Atlantic over attacks on American naval vessels escorting Allied merchantmen pushed the US and Germany further towards the brink. When the decisive moment came, however it was on the other side of the globe, and from a very different enemy. Japan's surprise attack on the Pacific fleet at Pearl harbor stunned America and although the damage done to American arms was ultimately not that severe the psychological blow it dealt to US self-assurance was devastating. Germany's equally surprise declaration of war a few days later confirmed America's place in the now-global war. President Roosevelt's immediate task is to prop up Allied defenses in the threatened SE Asian theatre while getting as much aid to the beleaguered Russians and British as possible and at the same time creating a mighty American war machine that can intervene decisively both in Europe and across the Pacific.;;;;;;;;;;X

URU_DESC;Under President Jose Batlle y Ordonez Uruguay saw its first era of stability. In two terms as president (1903 - 1907 and 1911 - 1915), he enacted economic and social reforms that separated the state and the church and took steps towards a moderate state socialism. The constitution of 1919 ruled the joint government consisting of a president and a state council. A system similar to Switzerland and representing the losing parties in the government along with an exemplary social legislature and the economic prosperity made Uruguay one of the most liberal and domestically stable states of Latin America. The Great Depression 1929 and 1930, hit Uruguay hard. Gabriel Terra seized the chance to establish a dictatorship by disbanding the state council in favor of an authoritarian system of government.;;;;;;;;;;X

TUR_DESC;Following World War One the territory of the defeated Ottoman Empire had been reduced to Anatolia in the peace treaty of Sävres 1920. Mustafa Kemal organized the national resistance against foreign invaders bringing about a major victory over the Greek in 1922, after which the Peace of Sävres was revised and Turkey was granted control of the (demilitarized) Bosporus. After the last Sultan had been deposed and the capital had been moved to Ankara the Republic of Turkey was proclaimed on 29th October 1923. Kemal who would begin calling himself AtatÅrk (Father of the Turks) from 1934 on began a cultural reform moving towards nationalist instead of religious ideals and abolishing the Caliphate in 1924. A year later, a Kurdish uprising was brutally suppressed and Kemal disposed of all dangerous opposition during that time. Kemal's reforms were aimed at removing the old elite and patterns of power. Islam was no longer state religion by constitution the Latin alphabet was introduced as well as the international calendar and time system. A code of laws was patterned after the Swiss civil law and the traditional Fez was no longer allowed to be worn. Economically the young state focused on industrialization and the building up of a decent infrastructure. When the Great Depression caused an agricultural crisis in Turkey in 1929, Kemal steered a course self-sufficiency. In 1934, the first Five Year Plan introduced the era of planned economy. At first the young republic found a good friend in the Soviet Union who had been the only country to support the Anatolian independence movement.;;;;;;;;;;X
TUR_41_DESC;Turkey struggled with its planned economy and its burdensome past in the late 1930s. The government enjoyed friendly relations with the Soviet Union due to ideological similarities. That changed, however, when in October 1939, a mutual assistance pact was signed with France and England which would spoil the friendly relations to the Soviet Union forever. When France was occupied in 1940, and Italy joined the war Turkey decided to stay neutral. In 1941, Hitler had conquered the Balkans and the agreement of Ankara to remain neutral secured Hitler's south flank against an attack by the Soviet Union on that front. In June 1941, the non-aggression pact between Turkey and Germany was signed, signaling a change in the alignment of the country in the relations with the Great Powers.;;;;;;;;;;X

At first the young republic found a good friend in the Soviet Union who had been the only country to support the Anatolian independence movement. However, when Turkey was allowed by international law to fortify the Bosporus and the Dardanelles the Western powers became more important especially Great Britain. Nevertheless, an independent foreign policy remained a main goal for Kemal AtatÅrk. After the death of AtatÅrk in 1938, Ismet InînÅ became president. During the political crisis that kept growing Ankara remained neutral keeping an equal distance to both London and Berlin.;;;;;;;;;;X

TIB_DESC;The Manchus who conquered China and established the Qing dynasty in the seventeenth century embraced Tibetan Buddhism as the Mongols had and developed close ties with the Tibetans. The Dalai Lama who by then had become the spiritual and temporal ruler of Tibet agreed to become the spiritual guide of the Manchu emperor. He accepted patronage and protection in exchange. This priest-patron relationship, which the Dalai Lama also maintained with numerous Mongol Khans and Tibetan nobles, was the only formal tie that existed between the Tibetans and Manchus during the Qing dynasty. It did not in itself affect Tibet's independence. On the political level, some powerful Manchu emperors succeeded in exerting a degree of influence over Tibet. Thus between 1720 and 1792 the Manchu emperors Kangxi Yong Zhen and Qianlong sent imperial troops into Tibet four times to protect the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan people from foreign invasion or internal unrest. It was these expeditions that provided them with influence in Tibet. The emperor sent representatives to the Tibetan capital Lhasa, some of whom successfully exercised their influence in his name over the Tibetan government, particularly with respect to the conduct of foreign relations. At the height of Manchu power which lasted a few decades the situation was not unlike that which can exist between a superpower and a neighboring satellite or protectorate. The subjection of a state to foreign influence and even intervention in foreign or domestic affairs however significant this may be politically does not in itself entail the legal extinction of that state. Consequently, although some Manchu emperors exerted considerable influence over Tibet they did not thereby incorporate Tibet into their empire, much less China. Manchu influence did not last for very long. It was entirely ineffective by the time the British briefly invaded Tibet in 1904 and ceased entirely with the overthrow of the Qing dynasty in 1911 and its replacement in China by a native republican government. Whatever ties existed between the Dalai Lama and the Qing emperor were extinguished with the dissolution of the Manchu Empire. From 1911 on Tibet successfully avoided undue foreign influence and behaved in every respect as a fully independent state. The 13th Dalai Lama emphasized his country's independent status externally in formal communications to foreign rulers and internally by issuing a proclamation reaffirming Tibet's independence and by strengthening the country's defenses. The attitude of most foreign governments with whom Tibet maintained relations implied their recognition of Tibet's independent status. The British government bound itself not to recognize Chinese suzerainty or any other rights over Tibet unless China signed the draft Simla Convention of 1914 with Britain and Tibet which China never did.;;;;;;;;;;X

TECH_NAVAL_DOC_NAME;Naval Warfare Doctrines;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_NAVAL_DOC_DESC;A military doctrine can be described as a paradigmatic solution to certain formulated problems of war. It defines the goal, the means and the operational procedures of the combat. The doctrine may define these issues in the scope of strategic, operational and tactical operations. The field of doctrines is at least as important as a nation's gains in technological research. A navy equipped with the latest ships will be defeated by an enemy with a more advanced doctrinal approach to combat.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_NAVAL_DESC;This field of research allows a nation to develop a naval power projection capability. If your war effort relies either upon controlling the enemy by projecting your own power over the sea, or by denying the enemy the ability to project his own power, this field is vital. Research will allow a nation to build capital ships such as Battleships and Aircraft Carriers as well as convoys and their escorts shipping supplies across the ocean. Another important aspect of this field of research is the amphibious warfare capability that can be developed.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_SUB_5_NAME;Improved Submarine Construction;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_SUB_5_DESC;By engaging in research in this field, your country will learn how to produce Long-Range Submarines of a higher quality and stamina than the older Medium Range Submarines.

TECH_LEVEL_SUB_12_NAME;Nuclear Submarine Propulsion;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_SUB_12_DESC;In the field of Nuclear technology you have designed a propulsion system based on a small nuclear reactor. Now an old dream of submariners can be fulfilled, unlimited range and high underwater speed. The problem is making the reactor small enough and to secure it safely so that the crew will not be affected by radiation.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_9_NAME;Nuclear Delivery Vehicles;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_9_DESC;At this point you may modify the Flying Bomb and the Flying Rocket to carry a nuclear warhead instead of a conventional one. In order to be able to go from theoretical to applied knowledge you must have first researched nuclear technology.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_8_NAME;Advanced Rocket and Jet Design;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_8_DESC;At this point you have the theoretical, and hopefully, the applied research to deepen your knowledge in the field of rocketry, thereby upgrading your weaponry by applied science. This research will allow the development of the turbojet engine for better aircraft, offensive and defensive missiles increasing the combat values of aircraft and upgrading air defense systems with missiles.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_7_NAME;Flying Rocket Development;;;;;;;;;;X

TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_5_NAME;Flying Bomb and Rocket Testing;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_5_DESC;This is one of the most time and resource intensive pieces of research that must take place in order to attain the great vehicles of destruction. The launch procedure must be perfected and trajectory test flights made to check real problems concerning these flying bombs and rockets. Research can also go into letting rockets launch from aircraft or ships.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_4_NAME;Jet Engine Design;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_4_DESC;Four different methods seemed possible at the time. In order of design complexity they were the solid-fuel rocket, the liquid-fuel rocket, the ramjet and the turbojet. All of these provided forward thrust by constant recoil verses the propeller, which literally drags a vehicle through the air.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_3_NAME;Improved Rocket Design;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_3_DESC;With the Military Test and Research Facilities and the insights into basic rocket design, the next step in the project is to broaden and deepen it in quality. It will enable research into a new type of rocket fuel, a miniature steam engine for launch equipment and a basic autopilot to guide larger rockets to their targets.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_2_NAME;Military Test and Research Facility;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_2_DESC;Rocket Test and Research Facilities were found in most major countries during the war. But only nations with Military Test and Research Facilities could produce military applications in the field of rocketry. Therefore, it is essential to build these facilities in order to benefit from the research.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_12_NAME;ICBM Development;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_12_DESC;The last step to the ultimate power in the modern era is the development of the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM), which can reach the most remote places on earth. Armed with a nuclear warhead, it constitutes the weapon of ultimate destruction. By refining research into the Ballistic Missile with understandings of multi-stage rocketry it is ultimately possible to construct silo-based ICBMs.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_11_NAME;Ballistic Missile Development;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_11_DESC;With the knowledge and usage of large rockets as vehicles of war comes a wish to increase operational range and accuracy to hit the target. Introducing rockets of even larger proportions can do this and if range and accuracy are good enough, then these improved flying rockets are called Ballistic Missiles. It is now possible to test and develop a very large rocket and a new computerized launch and guidance system, which will allow the Ballistic Missile.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_10_NAME;Mobile Launch Sites;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_10_DESC;Historically the static nature of large rocket systems originates from the lack of adequate electronic and hydraulic equipment. Basically the Flying Bombs and Rockets were launched from static positions. Efforts were put into making them as transportable as possible, mainly by using a large vehicle that moved rather quickly as they were at the same time large enough to launch from.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_1_NAME;Basic Rocket Design;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ROCKET_1_DESC;The first step in this project is to make the most basic advancement into rocket fuel, ballistics and flight trajectories and some sort of guidance system.

TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_9_NAME;Atomic Bomb Development;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_9_DESC;Developing the A-Bomb is like understanding fission in the laboratory, but now in a different environment. The bomb must be constructed correctly, it must detonate when and where you want it to, and the fission itself must be efficient enough. All this must be researched in both theory and practice.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_8_NAME;Nuclear Reactor Operability;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_8_DESC;One of the later phases of the Nuclear Project is to get your Nuclear Reactor going. For this you need both theoretical and practical technological knowledge. This theoretical research level makes you understand how it should be done and the applications let you try out your design. When all are researched you have an operating Nuclear Reactor, which produces bomb material.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_7_NAME;Nuclear Reactor Design;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_7_DESC;To continue down the road of Nuclear Power a functional reactor is everything. If you are not opting for a mere Thermal Diffusion Plant, then you need an experimental reactor which is then enlarged in steps until fission is powerful enough and of course, controlled. Now everything depends upon the original design and any flaws in it will take many years to correct. Even if the Thermal Diffusion Plant is your option you will need a good design, as that plant must produce vast amounts of below average bomb material.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_6_NAME;Nuclear Fuel and Bomb Material Analysis;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_6_DESC;The Isotope Separation Facility and the Betatron Particle Accelerator will now enable you to deepen your research into Nuclear Power, by analyzing potential nuclear fuels and bomb materials.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_5_NAME;Isotope Separation Process;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_5_DESC;At this point a functional process for creating nuclear fuel (natural isotopes) and bomb material (artificial isotopes) must be established to be worked into a sustainable method.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_4_NAME;Chain Reaction Process Discovered;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_4_DESC;To be able to explore the promises of nuclear power one must first prove that the neutrons initiating fission of uranium reproduce themselves in the process and that therefore, a multiplying chain reaction might occur with explosive force.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_3_NAME;Laboratory Produced Fission;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_3_DESC;To start treading the unexplored path to nuclear power one must first create a process in which atomic nuclei are split into fragments with the release of an enormous amount of energy.;;;;;;;;;;X

TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_10_NAME;Atomic Bomb Testing;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_10_DESC;The testing phase of the Nuclear Power project is the last one for true nuclear strike capability. By detonating at least one A-Bomb, but preferably more, in a rigged and scientifically controlled fashion, knowledge will be produced which will enable you to actually use your new weapons.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_1_NAME;Artificially Produced Radioactivity;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_NUCLEAR_1_DESC;To start researching nuclear power seriously, one must produce radioactive matter artificially by bombarding an atom and get its nucleus to capture the hitting neutron. The then unstable nucleus will emit an electron and become stable. Thus, the final, stable nucleus will be one unit higher in mass number and one unit higher in atomic number than the initial target nucleus. This finally provided the atoms and isotopes which are useful for nuclear research.;;;;;;;;;;X

TECH_LEVEL_INF_9_NAME;Advanced Battlefield C3I;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_INF_9_DESC;Another important issue was Battlefield C3I (Command, Control, Communication and Intelligence). The ability to quickly get information of where the enemy were and order a suitable task force to smash it was decisive to victory in the Second World War. To improve your ability you have to equip your combat formations with better and more durable radios, but also expand the command system from Division up to Army Headquarters.

TECH_LEVEL_ARMOR_6_NAME;Armour Skirts;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ARMOR_6_DESC;Armour Skirts were in reality large pieces of armor attached to the sides of a tank, covering parts of the hull structure and the tracks. The Armour skirts provided two advantages, firstly it protected the tracks that were easily destroyed by enemy fire, secondly it added armor protection to the entire tank, especially against High Explosive Anti-Tank (HEAT) projectiles.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ARMOR_5_NAME;Sloped Armour;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ARMOR_5_DESC;Sloped Armour had existed to some degree in armored vehicles for many years. However, not until World War II was it practically implemented in the overall design of tanks. The sloped armor increased the protection of armored vehicles without adding actual armor and weight. Instead the sloping armor could redirect a projectile, allowing it to skid off the vehicle's hull.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ARMOR_4_NAME;Assault Guns & Tank Destroyers;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ARMOR_4_DESC;The improvements in tank design allowed the chassis to be used for other purposes. The Assault Gun was a tank chassis fitted with an Infantry Gun. The Assault Gun would cooperate with the infantry and aid in the destruction of hardened targets and function as direct fire support. The Tank Destroyer would likewise move with the infantry and destroy hardened targets, primarily armored vehicles. The Assault Gun and the Tank Destroyer existed in both motorized infantry, mechanized and armored units.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ARMOR_3_NAME;Amphibious Tanks;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ARMOR_3_DESC;The first amphibious tanks allowed the Marine Unit to pack a much heavier punch on the battlefield and the landing beach.

TECH_LEVEL_ARMOR_2_NAME;Welded Armour;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ARMOR_2_DESC;The first armored vehicles with welded armor were made possible by better welding techniques. This allowed vehicles to be armored to a much higher degree than previously, and this armor did not prove hazardous to the crew. It could theoretically be made as thick as the designers wanted, the limits were instead imposed by engine and suspension technology.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ARMOR_12_NAME;Armoured Personnel Carriers;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ARMOR_12_DESC;While troops had been given some degree of protection in various armored troop carriers, they had always been limited in their function. All vehicles had been open-topped giving little or no protection against indirect fire. The armored Personnel Carrier (APC) allowed troops to move over the battlefield in a completely enclosed vehicle providing maximum protection. It also allowed them to move in close proximity to the tank troops.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ARMOR_11_NAME;Super-Heavy Tanks;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ARMOR_11_DESC;The Super-Heavy Tank was a tank of nothing but monstrous proportions. Modern Main Battle Tanks are small vehicles in comparison, regarding both size and weight. These tanks were to the scientists and designers of the time the next natural step in development after the Heavy Tank. The Super-Heavy Tank would have impenetrable armor and would thus roam the battlefield unchallenged.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ARMOR_10_NAME;Infrared Gun Sights;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ARMOR_10_DESC;The Infrared Gun Sight allowed a tank crew to illuminate their environment with an infrared light and obtain a picture through a receiver. Thus, a tank equipped with an infrared floodlight could allow its gunner to detect the enemy in the dark. The equipment was however vulnerable to the enemy if they were equipped with an infrared receiver/viewer which could very easily detect the emitter lamp used to illuminate the environment.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ARMOR_1_NAME;Riveted Armour;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_ARMOR_1_DESC;The first armored vehicles came into field service in World War I. These all had riveted armor. This armor, complemented with techniques of bolting, made for a less than perfect protection. When a vehicle with riveted bolted armor was hit by a heavy projectile, its occupants risked being chopped alive by flying bolts and rivets. This was all the designers had to make do with since the welding techniques of the time did not allow for welded armor.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_AIR_DOC_6_NAME;Late War Aerial Combat Testing;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_AIR_DOC_6_DESC;Real life combat tested the strength of the doctrine. Good ones where refined, and bad ones where flushed out with the bathwater.

TECH_LEVEL_AIR_DOC_1_NAME;Great War Aerial Experience Analysis;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LEVEL_AIR_DOC_1_DESC;These doctrines are developed from the experience drawn from World War I. The lessons learned in that war have led to a massive reconsideration of how combat operations should be conducted effectively.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LAND_DOC_NAME;Land Warfare Doctrines;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_LAND_DOC_DESC;A military doctrine can be described as a school of theory on how combat is to be conducted. It defines the goal, the means and the operational procedures of the combat. The doctrine may define these issues in the scope of strategic, operational and tactical operations. The field of doctrines is at least as important as a nation's gains in technological research. An army equipped with the latest equipment will be defeated by an enemy with a more advanced doctrinal approach to combat. It is also very important for a nation to make decisions on whether to develop a defensive or offensive doctrine since it will be costly to maintain two doctrines.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_L_AIR_NAME;Light Aircraft Research;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_L_AIR_DESC;This field of research allows a nation to develop fighter aircraft. These fighters can be used to escort bombers and other heavy aircraft and ensure that they reach their targets.

TECH_INDUSTRY_DESC;;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_H_AIR_NAME;Heavy Aircraft Research;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_H_AIR_DESC;This field of research allows a nation to develop bombers and air transports. This field is vital for a nation that needs to strike at the enemy from a distance. Bombers are tremendously effective in destroying the enemy's industry and in crushing the morale of the enemy by bombing his population centers. Bombers however are heavy and slow, and need fighters to escort them and protect them against enemy fighters.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_ELECTRONICS_NAME;Electronics Research;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_ELECTRONICS_DESC;This field of research allows a nation to develop a multitude of not only important, but also necessary applications. Most importantly this field will lead to the development of the radar, which is vital to achieving success in the war. The research will also enable improved radio communications equipment. A nation will be able to develop coding machines and eventually general-purpose computers. These computers are vital for a nuclear research program.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_EFFECTS;Effects     [U] = on upgrade;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_ARTILLERY_NAME;Artillery Research;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_ARTILLERY_DESC;This field of research allows a nation to develop artillery pieces of various configurations and functions. This field is critical as all other fields depend upon it. Through research in this field for example, a nation can develop guns for its surface warships, artillery for its infantry units and artillery components, as well as tank guns and anti-tank guns for its armored units. In short this field cannot be overlooked by any nation.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_ARMOR_NAME;Armoured Vehicle Research;;;;;;;;;;X

TECH_APP_SUB_5_1_NAME;Large Fuel Tank Design;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_5_1_DESC;At this point it is necessary to design large fuel tanks and at the same time keep the sea-worthiness of the boat intact. These new, large fuel tanks are needed if you are going to be able to build Long-Range Submarines.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_4_4_NAME;Long Range Radio Communication;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_4_4_DESC;By creating a technique and procedure for Long-Range Radio Communication your submarines will have an excellent C3I advantage over the enemy.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_4_3_NAME;Basic Submarine Sonar;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_4_3_DESC;This underwater radar device allows your submarines to find other submarines. It can also be used as a basic surface radar with very short range, something that could be very useful at nights.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_4_2_NAME;Improved Conventional Torpedo;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_4_2_DESC;Your scientists have discovered a new method of correcting torpedo construction errors. This application gives you an improved conventional torpedo based upon this new knowledge. This service torpedo not only has greater accuracy, but also greater range. Historically this was the German T3.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_4_1_NAME;Torpedo Data Computer;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_4_1_DESC;This application will allow you remove the old mechanical submarine torpedo director, which the British used to call 'The Fruit Machine', and instead introduce the TDC or the electro-mechanical Torpedo Data Computer which vastly enhances the capability to plot and follow the courses of many torpedoes at once and towards many targets. It will give your submarines a heavier punch.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_3_4_NAME;Schnorkel Testing;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_3_4_DESC;A surfaced submarine was propelled by its diesel engine, but often it had to dive and seek underwater-protection from anti-submarine warfare vessels and aircraft, at which point it was running on a limited electric motor which only managed a few knots and had very limited endurance. By installing a simple pipe system, which enabled a periscoping submarine to operate its diesels, the snorkel thus gave it almost unlimited underwater range. This application will provide your scientists with the knowledge to install such a device later on.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_3_3_NAME;Streamlined Pressure Hulls Testing;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_3_3_DESC;At this point your scientists will start designing conventional pressure hulls in such a fashion that their streamlined feature makes the submarine less vulnerable to detection from enemy radars. The big problem is to do that and at the same time retain its capacity of withstanding high pressures.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_3_2_NAME;Torpedo Correction Trials and Testing;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_3_2_DESC;As your current service torpedo is often troubled by construction deficiencies, it is now time to research the means of correcting these fatal errors. When this new method has been discovered, your scientists are ready to create an improved conventional torpedo.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_3_1_DESC;One of the dreams of submariners is that of a submarine with an engine that would let it run as fast under water as over it. Such an engine required no air intake and therefore could run when a submarine was submerged and at the same time offered enough power to achieve speeds of around 25 knots. By starting out early and trying the concept out you may be able to build such submarines later on.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_12_2_NAME;Nuclear Powered Submarine (Sub Model IV);;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_12_2_DESC;By installing your nuclear propulsion in a submarine large enough, it will gain an unlimited range and energy.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_12_1_NAME;Emergency Shut-down System;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_12_1_DESC;This application will remedy the problem of securing the reactor safely so that the crew will not be affected by radiation. It also provides the boat with an Emergency Shut-Down System that will make it possible to stop the reactor fission.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_11_3_NAME;Single Propeller Silent Engine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_11_3_DESC;By constructing an underwater diesel engine that merely used one propeller, submarines became much harder to detect and the effect of a rubber-isolated engine is that the acoustic signature is also lower.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_11_2_NAME;Advanced Acoustic Torpedo;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_SUB_11_2_DESC;At this point you can upgrade your basic acoustic torpedo by introducing a new homing device, which cannot yet be countered by enemy surface ships. It is also faster and more reliable than the former version.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_9_2_NAME;Nuclear Modified Flying Rockets;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_9_2_DESC;To modify the Flying Rocket to deliver nuclear weapons requires extensive redesign and testing. This application will allow you to equip the Flying Rockets, the Ballistic Missiles and ICBMs of your Rocket Units with a nuclear warhead. Note that you must have a nuclear warhead with which to equip the delivery vehicle.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_9_1_NAME;Nuclear Modified Flying Bomb;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_9_1_DESC;To modify the Flying Bomb to deliver nuclear weapons requires extensive redesign and testing. This application will allow you to equip the Flying Bomb with a nuclear warhead. Note that you must have a nuclear warhead with which to equip the delivery vehicle. Historically drawings of a German V1 modified into a Nuclear Modified Flying Bomb existed.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_8_4_NAME;Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM);;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_8_4_DESC;This means further testing, refinement and development of a Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) used by Provincial Anti-Air Batteries against enemy bombers. It uses a solid-fuel rocket engine and is equipped with a radar homing device and proximity fuse. Historically this was the German Wasserfall.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_8_3_NAME;Air-to-Surface Missile (ASM);;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_8_3_DESC;This means further testing, refinement and development of an Air-to-Surface Missile (ASM) used by naval and tactical bombers against enemy surface ships.

TECH_APP_ROCKET_8_2_NAME;Air-to-Air Missile (AAM);;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_8_2_DESC;This means further testing, refinement and development of an Air-to-Air Missile (AAM) used by fighters against enemy bombers. It uses a liquid-fuel rocket engine and is equipped with a radar homing device and proximity fuse. Historically this was the German Ruhrstahl X-4.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_8_1_NAME;Turbojet Engine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_8_1_DESC;The Turbojet Engine is more complex than the Ramjet requiring a rapidly spinning compressor to push enough air into the combustion chamber so the engine can generate sufficient thrust. The biggest obstacle to realizing the dream of jet powered flight is in producing a compact turbojet that gives good thrust whilst standing up to extreme heat and vibration.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_7_6_NAME;Multi-Stage Rocket;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_7_6_DESC;The Multi-Stage Rocket is a weapon of approximately the same performance as the Flying Bomb. Its accuracy is slightly better, but its minuscule warhead of only 25 kilos prevents it from being an effective weapon of war. Instead, it is developed for research into the mysteries of the future. Historically this was the German Rheinbˆte Z-61.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_7_5_NAME;Spin Stabilization Corrections;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_7_5_DESC;The Multi-Stage Rocket does not have a guidance system as the Flying Bomb or the Flying Rocket, but instead its spin-stabilization, high velocity and good speed will ensure that it deviates very little from the target. However, it also means that the spin-stabilization must be perfect, a fact that must be ensured by corrections after the test flights.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_7_4_NAME;Multi-Stage Test Flights;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_7_4_DESC;The biggest problem with a Multi-Stage Rocket is of course the stages themselves. It is very important that they separate at the right moment and that they have had time to deliver all their thrusting power. This must now be calibrated in careful testing.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_7_3_NAME;Flying Rocket;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_7_3_DESC;The Flying Rocket is a fast, non-interceptable one-shot bomber unit with a low attack value of 1 ton of TNT. Its rather poor accuracy will only allow it to conduct Terror Bombing missions. Its movement is a bit peculiar. In controlled territory, it uses extremely slow land movement. When it is ordered to affect a mission it will move to the target-province in a straight line and with full air movement. It can later be modified to carry a nuclear warhead. Historically this was the German Vergeltungswaffen 2/A4 (V2).;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_7_2_NAME;Reinforced Ribs;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_7_2_DESC;At this point some mid-air structural failures must be solved by adding reinforcing ribs, a so-called 'Corset' around the fuel tank area.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_7_1_NAME;Advanced Gyroscope Autopilot;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_7_1_DESC;The Advanced Gyroscope Autopilot is a very complex guidance control system used in the Flying Rocket. It forced the Flying Rocket to fly in a rather straight line to its target, while the autopilot corrected everything but natural effects. Only if it is updated by radio-signals will it hit its target without too much drift. It is fairly reliable if tested properly. However, due to its construction its accuracy will decrease proportionally to the range to the target.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_6_3_NAME;Flying Bomb;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_6_3_DESC;The Flying Bomb is a rather slow interceptable one-shot bomber unit with a low attack value of only 1 ton of TNT. Its poor accuracy will only allow it to conduct Terror Bombing missions. Its movement is a bit peculiar. In controlled territory, it uses extremely slow land movement. When it is ordered to affect a mission it will move to the target-province in a straight line and with full air movement. If a certain bomber-class has been modified as a delivery vehicle, then it contains Flying Bombs when built. These may then only be launched from these aircraft in the air. It can later be modified to carry a nuclear warhead. Historically this was the German Vergeltungswaffen 1 (V1).;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_6_2_NAME;Modified Steering Fins;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_6_2_DESC;The steering fins are operated by the directional gyro of the guidance control system. Upon creation, it was not thought possible that they could be disrupted by force. However, if the fins are moved too far in one or the other direction, the system stops working and the Flying Bomb crashes. By modifying the system it will be less vulnerable to external forces such as explosions or the wingtip of an aircraft for example.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_6_1_NAME;Launch Catapult;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_6_1_DESC;To be able to kick-start the ramjet engine of the Flying Bomb it must be launched from a specially-made catapult. To make one without decreasing the performance and accuracy of the Flying Bomb is the big problem.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_5_4_NAME;Sea-launch tests;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_5_4_DESC;These tests must be performed if you want to be able to launch missiles from ships. The test is made with a number of different ships in different weather conditions to ensure optimal performance.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_5_3_NAME;Air-Launch tests;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_5_3_DESC;These tests must be performed if you want to be able to launch rockets from aircraft. The test is made with a number of different aircraft at different altitudes and speed to ensure optimal performance.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_5_2_NAME;Trajectory Test Flights;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_5_2_DESC;These tests must be performed to ensure that no structural damage destroys the rocket or that the external environment makes it deviate from its planned course.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_5_1_NAME;Ground Launch Tests;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_5_1_DESC;These tests must be performed to be able to launch the rocket without malfunction or the rocket deviating from its planned course.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_4_3_NAME;Ramjet Engine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_4_3_DESC;The Ramjet is simple in concept with the force of air ramming into the engine being sufficient for fuel to be introduced and ignited. The hot gases shooting through a tail pipe push the engine and the attached plane forward. Unfortunately, a ramjet does not begin to function unless its already traveling at a decent speed, requiring a second power plant, a launch catapult for example, to bring the rocket - or the aircraft - up to speed for the ramjet to take over.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_4_2_NAME;Liquid Fuel Rocket Engine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_4_2_DESC;A rocket motor works independently of the atmosphere carrying its own liquid fuel but also consuming it in a relatively short time.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_4_1_NAME;Solid Fuel Rocket Engine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_4_1_DESC;A rocket motor works independently of the atmosphere carrying its own solid fuel but also consuming it in a relatively short time.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_3_3_NAME;Gyroscope Autopilot;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_3_3_DESC;The Gyroscope Autopilot is a very simple guidance control system used in Flying Bombs. It forced the Flying Bomb to fly in a straight line to its target, while the autopilot merely corrected for side wind. A small timing device also provided a limited pre-set change of heading and means of arming it. It is not very reliable.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_3_2_NAME;Miniature Steam Engine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_3_2_DESC;The Miniature Steam Engine is used for driving LOX and alcohol fuel pumps.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_3_1_NAME;Liquid Rocket Fuel;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_3_1_DESC;Liquid Rocket Fuel is an important stepping-stone towards launching an advanced large rocket. It is rather reliable but sensitive to rough weather and environmental conditions. Vehicles propelled with it can attain the same high speed as those using the less advanced solid rocket fuel, but ranges are much greater due to the fuel's capacity of being portioned over time.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_2_3_NAME;Telemetrics Station;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_2_3_DESC;The primary use for a Telemetric Station is to be able to correct structural deficiencies and test guidance control systems later on. It is a vital piece of equipment for further research.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_2_2_NAME;Test Range;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_2_2_DESC;The primary uses for Test Ranges are launch and trajectory tests later on. It is a vital piece of equipment for further research in the project.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_2_1_NAME;Wind Tunnels;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_2_1_DESC;The primary uses for Wind Tunnels are aerodynamic and jet engine testing later on. It is a vital piece of equipment for further research.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_12_3_NAME;Intercontinental Ballistic Missile;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_12_3_DESC;The ICBM is a fast non-interceptable one-shot bomber unit with a low attack value 1 ton of TNT. Its excellent hit accuracy will allow it to conduct Terror Bombing, Strategic Bombardment and Tactical Bombardment missions. When built in controlled territory, it is silo-based and cannot move. When it is ordered to affect a mission it will move to the target-province in a straight line and with full air movement. Historically this model existed only as a drawing of the German Vergeltungswaffen 2/A10 (V2/A10).;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_12_2_NAME;ICBM Guidance System Computer;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_12_2_DESC;The ICBM Guidance System Computer is an even more complex guidance control system than the one used by the Ballistic Missile. It allows the ICBM to fly in a rather straight line to its target, while the autopilot corrects everything with very little deviation from the target. It can change heading a few degrees at several points, which are pre-set by time, during its flight. It is reliable if tested properly. However, due to its very complex construction, testing might take a long time. The main difference between the ICBM Guidance System Computer and the less complex version of its predecessor is that the longer distance traveled by the ICBM means that all figures must be updated minute by minute if the missile is required to hit its target.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_12_1_NAME;Multi-Stage Ballistic Missile Test Flights;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_12_1_DESC;Multi-Stage Ballistic Missile Test Flights have to be performed. These tests are completely different from previous tests. They must also be dimensioned for very large vehicles.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_11_2_NAME;Ballistic Missile;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_11_2_DESC;The Ballistic Missile is a fast non-interceptable one-shot bomber unit with a low attack value of 1 ton of TNT. Its good accuracy will allow it to conduct Terror Bombing and Strategic Bombardment missions. Its movement is a bit peculiar. In controlled territory, it uses extremely slow land movement. When it is ordered to affect a mission it will move to the target-province in a straight line and with full air movement. Historically this model existed only as a drawing of the German Vergeltungswaffen 2/A9 (V2/A9).;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_11_1_NAME;Gyrostabilized Launch Computer;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_11_1_DESC;The Gyrostabilized Launch Computer is a very complex guidance control system used in Ballistic Missiles and ICBMs. It allows the missile to fly in a rather straight line to its target, while the autopilot corrects everything with very little deviation from the target. It can change heading a few degrees at several points, which are pre-set by time, during its flight. It is rather reliable if tested properly. However, due to its very complex construction, testing might take a long time. It does not only work as a guidance control system, but also as a launching gyro-calculator correcting deviation from being launched at sea or from a moving object.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_10_1_NAME;Towed Submarine Container;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_10_1_DESC;The Towed Submarine Container is considered a Rocket Unit launching the Ballistic Missile. It consists of three containers towed by a Submarine Unit and contains the personnel, equipment and supplies to launch the rockets. In reality it can be doubted if a Flying Rocket could hit a designated target launching from a container in rough waters, but the Ballistic Missile is considered equipped with a gyro stabilizing computer and hydraulics.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_1_3_NAME;Joystick Wire Guidance;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_1_3_DESC;This semi-mechanical guidance control system works by sending electrical impulses from the control box to the weapon through a very thin cable. This enables the launch operator to guide the weapon with a joystick.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_1_2_NAME;Small Rocket Flight Tests;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_1_2_DESC;Small Rocket Flight Tests are necessary for further advancement into the research project. It means that extensive launch tests and trajectory tests of small rockets and prototypes for larger rockets are studied.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_1_1_NAME;Solid Rocket Fuel;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_ROCKET_1_1_DESC;Solid Rocket Fuel is the most basic fuel you need. It is very reliable and insensitive to rough weather and environment. Vehicles propelled with it can attain the same high speed as those using the more advanced liquid rocket fuel, but range is limited due to the propensity of solid fuels to have short burning times.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_9_3_NAME;Semi-Fission Bomb 235;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_9_3_DESC;This weak A-Bomb is a fast but inefficient use of bomb material. It is a fission bomb, but the fission is so inefficient because of the bad bomb material that less than 20 percent of it will actually fission. The production rate of this bomb is very low (0.5/Year). You now have an A-Bomb, but you still need a delivery vehicle such as a bomber aircraft or a ballistic missile to use it. Historically this was the Hiroshima-bomb.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_9_2_NAME;Nuclear Waste Bomb;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_9_2_DESC;This Poor Man's A-Bomb is not a fission bomb, but instead a conventional bomb that spreads radioactive waste over a large area. It is weak and you can only create a limited number of bombs from all the material you have produced. You now have an A-Bomb, but you still need a delivery vehicle such as a bomber aircraft or a ballistic missile to use it.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_9_1_NAME;Detonators;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_9_1_DESC;As with any fission it must be ignited by something, thus you must now research a functional and efficient detonator.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_8_4_NAME;Applied Rare Minerals;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_8_4_DESC;In addition to the moderator and reflector materials there are a number of other rare minerals that must be obtained and used during the fission process. These minerals are Beryllium, Zirconium, Thallium, Lithium, Boron, Borax and Boric Acid.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_8_3_NAME;Core Structure;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_8_3_DESC;Nuclear fission is not only potentially very dangerous, it is also used to produce electricity. The core structure is the large steel and concrete compartment the reactor core is placed in, and includes the coolant, all technical and electronic equipment and of course the turbine generators that produces electricity. It also includes the containment of burned-out nuclear fuel. If this structure has deficiencies then fission is hazardous or cumbersome at best.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_8_2_NAME;Reflector;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_8_2_DESC;As electrons in fission are highly mobile, a reflector is needed to stop radioactive material from leaving the reactor core. The usable materials are Heavy Water, Beryllium and Graphite. The problem is to produce an acceptable reflector.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_8_1_NAME;Moderator;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_8_1_DESC;As the probability of fission is often much higher with slower electrons than with fast ones, a Nuclear Reactor needs a moderator to get the electrons up to optimal speed and thus ensure the most efficient fission. The usable materials are Heavy Water, Beryllium and Graphite. The problem is to produce an acceptable moderator.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_7_3_NAME;Heavy Water Plant;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_7_3_DESC;To be able to continue and perhaps expand your nuclear project you need a lot of Heavy Water for your reactor. By building a Heavy Water Plant, you produce it, which will increase your chances of successfully producing bombs and energy later on. The Heavy Water Plant will increase the rate of nuclear bombs produced.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_7_2_NAME;Experimental Reactor;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_7_2_DESC;You need an Experimental reactor to test the design, make corrections and understand the problems with nuclear reactor handling.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_7_1_NAME;Thermal Diffusion Plant;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_7_1_DESC;This plant is essential for using uranium hexafluoride to separate the bomb material Uranium 235 from the fuel Uranium 238. With this plant, you actually start producing bomb material for the Semi-fission bomb, which you can create as an application when you have researched Atomic Bomb Development. You do not need any other applications under Nuclear Reactor Design or Nuclear Reactor Operability.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_6_6_NAME;Catalyzer: Tritium;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_6_6_DESC;This Bomb Material is one of the four roads that lead to Atomic Bombs and Nuclear Power. When it has been analyzed, it can be tested much later together with the Fission Bomb 233, and applied in a Tritium Bomb. This is the most powerful A-Bomb in the game.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_6_5_NAME;Material: Uranium 235;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_6_5_DESC;This Bomb Material is one of the four roads that lead to Atomic Bombs and Nuclear Power. When it has been analyzed, it can be separated from the Nuclear Fuel Uranium 238 in a Thermal Diffusion Plant. It will eventually lead to the Semi-Fission Bomb 235, which is better than the Nuclear Material Bomb, but worse than Fission Bomb 233, Fission Bomb 239 and the Tritium Bomb.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_6_4_NAME;Material: Plutonium 239;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_6_4_DESC;This Bomb Material is one of the four roads that lead to Atomic Bombs and Nuclear Power. When it has been analyzed, it can be separated from the Nuclear Fuel Uranium 238 in an Experimental Reactor. It will eventually lead to the Fission Bomb 239, which is better than the Nuclear Material Bomb and the Semi-Fission Bomb 235, but worse than Fission Bomb 233 and the Tritium Bomb.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_6_3_NAME;Material: Uranium 233;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_6_3_DESC;This Bomb Material is one of the four roads that lead to Atomic Bombs and Nuclear Power. When it has been analyzed, it can be separated from the Nuclear Fuel Thorium 232 in an Experimental Reactor. It will eventually lead to the Fission Bomb 233, the second best A-Bomb in the game. Which is better than the Nuclear Material Bomb, the Semi-Fission Bomb 235, and the Fission Bomb 239, but worse than the Tritium Bomb.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_6_2_NAME;Fuel: Uranium 238;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_6_2_DESC;This Nuclear Fuel is one of the two roads that lead to Atomic Bombs and Nuclear Power. When it has been analyzed, it will open the road for research on the good Bomb Material Plutonium 239 and the average Uranium 235.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_6_1_NAME;Fuel: Thorium 232;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_6_1_DESC;This Nuclear Fuel is one of the two roads that lead to Atomic Bombs and Nuclear Power. When it has been analyzed, it will open the road for research on the excellent Bomb Material Uranium 233.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_5_2_NAME;Betatron Particle Accelerator;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_5_2_DESC;This object must be constructed and become operable to be able to accelerate particles so that they will not be repelled by other particles of the same charge. The main purpose is to learn more about moving particles on a sub-atomic level. However, the Betatron can also be used to bombard non-radioactive material such as steel with radioactive particles and thus create large chunks of radioactive waste. If you only want to produce a Nuclear Waste Bomb you do not need to research into any more applications until you have researched Atomic Bomb Development.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_5_1_NAME;Isotope Separation Facility;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_5_1_DESC;This facility 'cleans' natural uranium from the unwanted isotopes that may disrupt or stall fission with the fuel intended. The main purpose of the facility though, is to obtain an insight into how the radioactive atoms and their isotopes behave in a non-laboratory environment.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_12_2_NAME;Early Industrial Nuclear Power Plants;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_12_2_DESC;By modifying a nuclear reactor to maximize the output of electricity and adding to it sufficient equipment to store and transport electricity the total Industrial Capacity will be greatly increased. 'It is not too much to expect that our children will enjoy in their homes electrical energy too cheap to meter, will know of great periodic regional famines in the world only as matters of history, will travel effortlessly over the seas and under them and through the air with a minimum of danger and at great speeds, and will experience a life span far longer than ours', Lewis L. Strauss Speech, Chairman of the US Atomic Energy Commission.  Historically, the first civilian power reactor at Shippingport, Pennsylvania come on line in 1957.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_12_1_NAME;Nuclear Propulsion Engines;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_12_1_DESC;By designing a propulsion system based on a small nuclear reactor, an old dream of submariners will be fulfilled, unlimited range and high underwater speed. The problem is making the reactor small enough and to secure it safely so that the crew will not be affected by radiation.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_11_2_NAME;APDU Ammo;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_11_2_DESC;Armour Piercing Depleted Uranium Ammunition, or APDU for short, can at this point be researched for use with the heaviest artillery class. It will increase the Hard Attack value of your units considerably.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_11_1_NAME;Tritium Bomb;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_11_1_DESC;This A-Bomb is a very efficient use of bomb material. It is a true fission bomb, boosted with tritium and ten times more powerful than both the 'normal' A-Bombs. The production rate of this bomb is good (2/Year). You now have an A-Bomb, but you still need a delivery vehicle such as a bomber aircraft or a ballistic missile to use it.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_10_3_NAME;Tritium Testing;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_10_3_DESC;Tritium can be used as a catalyst to boost the fission of Uranium 233, thus creating a Boosted A-Bomb. First, the Lithium must be converted into Tritium in a Betatron Particle Accelerator, and then the scientists have to figure out how to control the catalyst phase of the fission. It will lead to the Tritium Bomb.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_10_2_NAME;Fission Bomb 239;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_10_2_DESC;This A-Bomb is a rather efficient use of bomb material. It is a true fission bomb, though Plutonium 239 limits its power somewhat. The production rate of this bomb is average (1.5/Year). You now have an A-Bomb, but you still need a delivery vehicle such as a bomber aircraft or a ballistic missile to use it. Historically this was the Nagasaki-bomb.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_10_1_NAME;Fission Bomb 233;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NUCLEAR_10_1_DESC;This A-Bomb is a rather efficient use of bomb material. It is a true fission bomb, and when boosted with tritium it will become the Tritium Bomb. The production rate of this bomb is low (1/Year). You now have an A-Bomb, but you still need a delivery vehicle such as a bomber aircraft or a ballistic missile to use it.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_6_3_NAME;Nuclear Support Organization;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_6_3_DESC;In order for a navy to operate nuclear vessels an enormous support organization had to be developed. The navy organization would now have to operate nuclear material and nuclear waste material. It would have to construct maintenance facilities for the on-loading and off-loading of these materials. Furthermore, it would have to train and equip an entire corps of nuclear operators and engineers to operate equipment and facilities. This Nuclear Support Organization was essential for a navy to operate nuclear vessels.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_6_2_NAME;Submarine Underway Replenishment;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_6_2_DESC;This doctrine was developed out of a necessity to supply a large submarine fleet while being denied access to the surface by the enemy. For nations that did not have a large surface navy, but did have a sizable submarine force it became very difficult to keep that submarine force supplied. Since the surface was controlled by the enemy, the submarines would sometimes have to use remote friendly ports where supplies would have to be routed overland. With the development of the Supply Submarine, a new approach presented itself. An entire supply network could be established under the sea to keep the submarine force supplied. Historically this doctrine was implemented by the Germans who called their Supply Submarines 'Sea-Cows'.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_6_1_NAME;Maritime Power Projection Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_6_1_DESC;The Maritime Power Projection Doctrine was a refinement of the Maritime Air Superiority Doctrine and the Carrier Battle Group Doctrine. It stipulated that the concentration and coordination of naval aviation be used not only to assert air superiority, but also to attain strategic national goals through the projection of maritime power. This allowed one or several taskforces to approach a nation's waters and through force, or the threat of force, make that nation take a specific desired action. This doctrine was unique in that it allowed a naval force to have not only an impact on, but also total control of the actions on land. This doctrine lives on in a refined form today in modern times.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_5_7_NAME;SLOC Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_5_7_DESC;With the increased threat to merchant shipping convoys by the Sea-Lanes Denial Doctrine, it was critical to develop new operational guidelines. The Sea-Lanes Denial Doctrine stipulated that both Cruisers and Battleships should hunt and destroy convoys. However, it had been recognized that the heavy capital ships had become very vulnerable to naval aviation. The Carrier Battle Group Doctrine was proof of this. Therefore, to counter this new threat, a new doctrine which identified the importance of the sea-lanes as 'Sea-Lanes of Communication' - or SLOC - was developed. It was established that these SLOCs were instrumental to a powerful nation's survival, and that these should be protected as vigorously as the motherland's soil. The conclusion from this was that the new threat of Cruisers and Battleships directed against the convoys had to be countered by any means possible. Since these capital ships were highly vulnerable to naval aviation it was decided that Escort Aircraft Carriers be developed to protect the convoys. These Escort Aircraft Carriers were not equipped to be included in taskforces as carrier groups, but were rather cheaply and rapidly produced.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_5_6_NAME;Operational Beachhead Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_5_6_DESC;The Operational Beachhead Doctrine was a further development of the Tactical Beachhead Doctrine but on a larger scale. The doctrine recognized the need for large formations to operate independently while conducting amphibious operations. This meant that the formations would have to carry with them onto the landing zone their own independent supply organization and command and control functions if they where to maintain the landing zone. The operational beachhead became instrumental in securing entry points for an invasion by ground units.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_5_5_NAME;Maritime Invasion Organization;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_5_5_DESC;: The Maritime Invasion Organization allowed the organization of troops and the development of technology for a large scale maritime invasion. This meant broadening the scope of the operation and giving it higher goals to attain. A large specialized supply organization and special detachments must be formed in order to conduct a maritime invasion.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_5_4_NAME;Island-Jumping Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_5_4_DESC;Once the Base Control Doctrine had been established and implemented the need for a new advanced type of amphibious operations demanded a new doctrinal thinking. In some areas of the world, most notably the Pacific, the control of enemy naval bases meant that one had to control small islands in between the friendly bases and the enemy naval base in order to retain supply lines. These operations proved very difficult in terms of logistics. No unit was better fitted for the task than the Marine unit. Therefore, in order to control the enemy's naval bases, it became vital to have an amphibious doctrine that could support these operations. This became the so called 'Island-Jumping' Doctrine.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_5_3_NAME;Submarine-Air Force Coordination;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_5_3_DESC;The different arms of the military had not been used to coordinating their operations in any real sense. During World War II however, it became critical for successful operations that the submarine force and the air force should cooperate and coordinate their operations. Obstacles had to be overcome at the command and control level, to streamline logistics and signals systems. But it was also a matter of influencing the respective officer corps to realize the value of cooperation, and to force the implementation of the changes.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_5_2_NAME;Maritime Air Superiority Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_5_2_DESC;The Maritime Air Superiority Doctrine was a refinement of the Combat Air Patrol Doctrine and the Carrier Group Doctrine. It called for the carrier battle group to exert its airpower to not only cover the task force, but to create a state of friendly air superiority in the entire sea-zone. This doctrine meant that a task force with a carrier battle group could move into an area of operations creating air cover and air superiority within that sea zone thereby effectively minimizing the enemy air threat.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_5_1_NAME;Sea-Lanes Denial Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_5_1_DESC;The Sea-Lanes Denial Doctrine was a refinement of the Indirect Approach Doctrine. It stipulated that not only specific ships like cruisers, but all surface naval ships should be directed to the role of denying the enemy access to his sea-lanes. In essence, this doctrine meant that naval warfare shifted focus. Aircraft Carriers and naval aviation would destroy enemy naval ships while capital ships like Cruisers and Battleships should maneuver into the enemy's sea-lanes and deny him the access to these sea-lanes, thereby disabling his ability to convoy.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_4_3_NAME;Navy-Army Coordination;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_4_3_DESC;The different arms of the military had not been used to coordinating their operations in any real sense.

TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_4_1_NAME;Carrier Battlegroup Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_4_1_DESC;The Carrier Battle Group Doctrine was a refinement of the Carrier Group Doctrine and further recognized the need for naval air operations to counter the enemy's capital ships. The development of the Carrier Battle Group meant that the navy was prioritizing the Aircraft Carrier over the Battleship. No longer was the Battleship the grand centerpiece of the task force, but instead the group of Aircraft Carriers carried the lion's share of the naval power at sea.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_3_7_NAME;Open Seas Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_3_7_DESC;The Open Seas Doctrine was a further refinement of the Sea-Lanes Doctrine. It further recognized the need for the large convoys to be protected from the increased threat of cruisers and submarine 'Wolfpacks'. In order to keep the sea-lanes open and protect the convoys special Escort Destroyers were developed. These Escort Destroyers where cheaper and built faster than the regular Destroyers, but they were not equipped to escort capital ships.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_3_6_NAME;Tactical Beachhead Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_3_6_DESC;The Tactical Beachhead Doctrine recognized the need for sub-units to operate independently while conducting amphibious operations. This meant that the sub-units would have to carry with them onto the landing zone their own independent supply organization and command and control functions if they were to maintain the landing zone. This became instrumental in amphibious operations, and such independent self-sufficient landing-zones became known as a 'Beachheads'.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_3_5_NAME;Base Control Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_3_5_DESC;While the Base defense Doctrine had recognized the need for protecting friendly naval bases, the development of the Marine unit now allowed the enemy's naval bases to be targeted and captured. It was recognized that it would become increasingly important to threaten, and if necessary capture, enemy naval bases in order to deny him their usage. If the enemy's use of friendly bases was crippled, it would decrease his operational range and his ability to threaten friendly territory.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_3_4_NAME;Wolfpack Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_3_4_DESC;This doctrine was developed from the need to coordinate submarines to hunt the large convoys of the sea-lanes. Previously submarines had operated independently with limited results against convoys. However, by coordinating the search for convoys of merchant shipping between submarines meant that once spotted and identified, a convoy was no longer safe as large groups of submarines would converge on it and attack it. This doctrine would prove highly effective.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_3_3_NAME;Combat Air Patrol Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_3_3_DESC;This doctrine recognized the need to protect the task force from enemy aircraft. This could be done by constantly maintaining friendly aircraft in the skies above the task force. These continuous operations put a high strain on personnel, materiel and supplies. When implemented the Combat Air Patrol Doctrine would place a protective shield over the task force defending it from enemy air threats.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_3_2_NAME;Indirect Approach Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_3_2_DESC;The Indirect Approach Doctrine was a refinement of the Merchant Raider Doctrine. It further recognized the success that could be gained by allowing cruisers to act as raiders, hunting down enemy merchant shipping. What set this doctrine apart from the Merchant Raider Doctrine was the recognition of the importance of hindering the enemy merchant shipping from reaching its destination. It was recognized that the battle of the seas had become less a battle between capital ships for the contest of the open seas, but rather a battle of keeping friendly sea-lanes open to shipping, while at the same time denying the enemy access to his sea-lanes. This doctrine stood in contrast to the Decisive Battle Doctrine stipulating the exact opposite thinking. However, these two doctrines were historically developed parallel to one another since they both derived from the same Blue Water Doctrine.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_3_1_NAME;Decisive Battle Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_3_1_DESC;The Decisive Battle Doctrine was a doctrine built on the Blue Water Doctrine. It called for a massive concentration of heavy capital ships to be formed into taskforces that would theoretically overwhelm the enemy. It was a doctrinal approach of sheer force in numbers. Capital ships should be bigger and carry heavier firepower. These ships should then be massed into groups that would be undefeatable. This doctrine stood in contrast to the Indirect Approach Doctrine stipulating the exact opposite thinking. However, these two doctrines were historically developed parallel to one another since they both derived from the same Blue Water Doctrine.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_2_4_NAME;Naval Underway Replenishment;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_2_4_DESC;This doctrine allowed naval units to be supplied while at sea. This meant that they did not have to go into port as often as previously as most of their supplies could now be replenished while underway.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_2_3_NAME;Fleet Supply Convoy organization;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_2_3_DESC;The development of the Fleet Supply Convoy Organization allowed for naval units to be supplied more effectively than previously. The development of ships specifically tailored to carry fuel, ammunition and supplies allowed for a proper fleet supply organization. This should not be confused with the supply convoys of civilian merchant shipping.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_2_2_NAME;Unlimited Submarine Warfare Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_2_2_DESC;This doctrine allowed submarines to conduct all-out war on all enemy shipping, regardless of the shipping being civilian or military, and without the previous strict conditions of identification. This doctrine was not a development of military operational thinking, but rather a political decision that was not lightly taken. Submarines had had a limited use since it was difficult to identify ships positively, and since civilian shipping should not be targeted. But once the politicians had overcome their reluctance to use the submarine force indiscriminately, the submarines could be used effectively against all enemy shipping.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_2_1_NAME;Carrier Group Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_2_1_DESC;The Carrier Group Doctrine was a refinement of the Naval Aviation Doctrine and further recognized the need for naval air operations to counter the enemy's capital ships. This doctrine allowed Aircraft Carriers to be coordinated into groups. The Aircraft Carriers in these groups could coordinate their air operations in order to deliver more combat power to the enemy.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_1_6_NAME;Base defense Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_1_6_DESC;This doctrine was the second to recognize the need to protect the friendly naval bases. The old 19th century doctrine stated that it was crucial to not allow the enemyís ships to strike at friendly naval bases while these where unprotected. In the Aftermath of the Great War, the need for invasion defense against land units was highlighted. This led to the development of coastal fortifications and defenses, and thus a more thorough doctrine. While this doctrine did not require the development of marine units, it would still define the doctrinal use and approach to amphibious operations late on in the war.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_1_5_NAME;Sea Lanes Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_1_5_DESC;This doctrine represented a new thinking in the shipping of supplies. In order to counter the doctrines and technologies that allowed the enemy to hunt and destroy a nation's merchant shipping, a new approach to shipping was needed. This became the Sea-Lanes Doctrine. In theory, it meant two things. Firstly, the shipping should be coordinated into massive convoys where the ships could be protected by the sheer size of the group, not unlike a shoal of fish. Secondly, these convoys could be moved across the oceans in predetermined sea-lanes which would be protected from the enemy.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_1_4_NAME;Combat Unit Transport Procedure;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_1_4_DESC;This was a procedure of operations rather than a doctrine. In order for ground units to be transported by ship to a friendly port it did not take much advanced technology. All industrialized nations had merchant ships that could be used as transports. But the task of organizing such transport was difficult and required experience. Thus in order for a nation to transport ground units by sea it must first acquire this knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_1_3_NAME;Naval Aviation Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_1_3_DESC;The Naval Aviation Doctrine led to the creation of the first Aircraft Carriers. Previously capital ships had often carried a few aircraft onboard for use in the role of reconnaissance. But as the torpedo bomber was developed it was recognized that aircraft were very effective in countering the increasingly heavy capital ships. This led to the creation of ships dedicated to this task, the Aircraft Carrier. The Aircraft Carrier and its aircraft also needed specially-trained pilots which led to the creation of naval aviation. Ultimately this school of doctrine would lead to the death of the Battleship and the refinement of the Aircraft Carrier.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_1_2_NAME;Merchant Raider Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_1_2_DESC;This doctrine defined the role of the cruiser as a merchant raider. This school of thought proposed that the cruiser be taken away from the sea battle between capital ships and instead be used to hunt the open seas for enemy shipping. This was the first naval doctrine to target the enemy indirectly by going after his merchant shipping rather than destroying his ships.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_1_1_NAME;Blue Water Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_NAVAL_DOC_1_1_DESC;This doctrine stipulated that the capital ships of the navy, the battleships and the cruisers, should conduct combat away from the coastal waters in the deep open waters on the ocean. This was called the Blue Water Doctrine as opposed to the Brown Water Doctrine used earlier by some nations. This doctrine did not emphasize a specific objective for keeping the capital ships on the deep open seas, rather it concluded that combat between capital ships should be conducted there. It was a theory of combat philosophy rather than a strict operational conduct.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_6_3_NAME;Airborne Command Organization;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_6_3_DESC;The introduction of the Operational Maneuver Warfare Doctrine demanded that formation command units could maneuver in conjunction with the units under its command. This required a re-organization of the headquarters from a static command post to an airborne command post. This led to a reform in command operations.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_6_2_NAME;Division Long-Range Reconnaissance Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_6_2_DESC;This doctrine was implemented from the need to identify and pinpoint the enemy main force and its positions for its encirclement and destruction. It was acknowledged that this had to be conducted by a special force specifically equipped and organized for the task. This became the first long-range reconnaissance formation. This was a doctrine of the School of Offensive Operations.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_6_1_NAME;Task Force Offensive Organization;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_6_1_DESC;This organization was developed through extensive field tests based on the experience drawn from fighting late in the war. The implementation of these taskforces, which the Germans called 'Kampfgruppe' and the Americans dubbed 'Team' was made through the Operational Maneuver Warfare Doctrine. This was an organization based on the School of Offensive Operations.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_5_8_NAME;Operational Maneuver Warfare Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_5_8_DESC;Perhaps the most famous doctrine of the war, the Operational Maneuver Warfare Doctrine, or 'Blitzkrieg'-doctrine, was the fundamental doctrine that would dominate land warfare for almost 50 years. The doctrine called for armored formations to attack the enemy defensive positions to achieve a break-through. This break-through would then be optimally utilized to press further armored formations through it, which would break out behind enemy lines and conduct exploitation operations. The goal of this doctrine was not necessarily the destruction of enemy forces, but rather the destruction of the enemy's will to fight. The exploiting units should quickly maneuver to seize key points and objectives of strategic importance to the enemy, persuading him that he was defeated before the military issue was settled. In essence, operational maneuver warfare aims to force pursuit, which results in highly lopsided fighting situations and easy victories, as opposed to attrition oriented or set piece battles, which generally yield heavy losses for both sides.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_5_7_NAME;Armoured Spearhead Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_5_7_DESC;The organizational questions raised by the Force Concentration Doctrine led to the development of the armored Spearhead Doctrine. This doctrine implemented a new flexible task-oriented organization on the sub-unit level that allowed a unit to concentrate its force effectively. This organization called for standard sub-units in a flexible command structure, allowing for sub-units to be combined and re-combined in a free fashion to form small taskforces with a specific mission. It was perhaps not so much the organization of the sub-unit that proved pivotal, but rather the organization and training of the command structure and officer corps. This was a doctrine of the School of Offensive Operations.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_5_6_NAME;Force Concentration Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_5_6_DESC;The Force Concentration Doctrine was an integral part of the Operational Maneuver Warfare Doctrine. It called for the necessity of the rapid concentration of force at the decisive point - what the Germans called the 'Schwerpunkt'. This concentration had to happen very quickly in a coordinated fashion at the time of the break-through, while still maintaining unit cohesion. It was fundamentally important to be able to shift the axis of maneuver in order for the combat power to convene. The restriction of the doctrine was how to organize units and sub-units in a fashion that allowed them to implement this doctrine. This was a doctrine of the School of Offensive Operations.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_5_5_NAME;Opposed Obstacle Crossing Operations;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_5_5_DESC;The increase in mechanization had allowed for the development of new equipment that could be utilized to cross water obstacles under enemy fire. These operations were technically very difficult and required perfection in training in order to ensure success on the battlefield. Once effectively mastered the Opposed Obstacle Crossing Operation proved an invaluable tool in operational warfare. This was a doctrine of the School of Offensive Operations.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_5_4_NAME;Synchronized Artillery Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_5_4_DESC;The improvements in combined arms warfare and maneuver artillery enabled the delivery of massive artillery fire in exact co-ordination with units in the forward area. This doctrine called for a synchronization of different artillery units in real-time to allow for a previously unseen concentration of fire. This was an extremely effective way of halting and channeling enemy spearheads that had broken through the defensive lines. The only restriction of the doctrine was the speed by which reconnaissance intelligence could be relayed to the firing units. This was a problem that the Soviet Union developed further into the Reconnaissance Strike Complex Doctrine, and which it would continue to develop over the next 50 years.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_5_3_NAME;Special Operations Warfare Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_5_3_DESC;This doctrine was brought about by the thinking that small specially trained and equipped teams could be used as advanced long-range reconnaissance and saboteur units. These units were expensive to train, but once employed they proved very valuable.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_5_2_NAME;Improved Maneuver Artillery Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_5_2_DESC;The Improved Maneuver Artillery Doctrine was in essence an implementation of combat technical procedures and systems on a doctrinal level. The doctrine brought about a new level of synchronization and effectiveness in artillery battery and battalion organizations. Firing procedures could now be synchronized in time and space to attain previously unseen fire delivery effectiveness.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_5_1_NAME;Elastic Defense Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_5_1_DESC;The introduction of the Operational Maneuver Warfare Doctrine had proved that the Deep Area Defense Doctrine could not hold back the spearheads of the 'Blitzkrieg'-operations. In response the Elastic Defense Doctrine was developed. It still called for a multi-layered defense in fortified positions. But it complemented those defenses with a small but highly lethal armored force close behind the layers in depth. When the enemy attacked and broke through the first layer the defender could identify the axis of the main attack. When that attack was entangled in the second layer the armored reserve struck. Once the enemy had been repelled or destroyed, the first layer moved to a new defensive position behind the second layer. In this leapfrog fashion with armored reserves the enemy could be defeated. This was a doctrine of the School of Defensive Operations.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_4_7_NAME;Mechanized HQs;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_4_7_DESC;The introduction of the combined arms warfare doctrine demanded that formation command units could maneuver in conjunction the units under its command. This required a re-organization of the headquarters from a static command post to a mobile command post. This led to a reform in command operations.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_4_6_NAME;Forward Area Logistics Organization;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_4_6_DESC;The Forward Area Logistics Organization allowed a ground combat unit to be re-supplied while maneuvering at the forward area rather then having to pull back to a rear-area supply point.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_4_5_NAME;Motorized Logistics Organization;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_4_5_DESC;As the military of the war became more technology-intensive and vehicles and calibers became heavier, the logistics became ever more important. The increased motorization and mechanization of the ground combat units also required much more fuel than previously, and so the logistical system had to manage many hundreds of tons where previously it had handled a few dozen tons. An organization that could deal with these volumes at the correct speed had to be developed.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_4_4_NAME;Signal Intelligence Operations;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_4_4_DESC;The technological development of signal interception and jamming units led to the development of operations aimed at attrition and disrupting the enemy command structure. These operations internalized the use of this equipment and the units tasked with this became a new troop of arms.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_4_3_NAME;Corps Long-Range Reconnaissance Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_4_3_DESC;This doctrine was implemented from the need to identify and pinpoint the enemy main force and its positions for its encirclement and destruction. It was acknowledged that this had to be conducted by a special force specifically equipped and organized for the task. These became the first long-range reconnaissance formations. This was a doctrine of the School of Offensive Operations.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_4_2_NAME;Divisional Offensive Organization;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_4_2_DESC;This organization was developed through extensive field tests based on the experience drawn from World War I. The regimen defined combat operation procedures for units. This was an organization based on the School of Offensive Operations.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_4_1_NAME;Divisional Defensive Organization;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_4_1_DESC;This organization was developed through extensive field tests based on the experience drawn from World War I. The regimen defined combat operation procedures for units. This was an organization based on the School of Defensive Operations.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_3_5_NAME;Triphibious Operations Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_3_5_DESC;The development of several doctrinal schools for specialized troops like Marines and Paratroops and improved combined arms warfare had led to the possibility of synchronizing all these elements in combat operations on the operational level. This allowed for Marines, Paratroops, and Tactical Bombers to function in a synchronized manner for combat operations. This in its turn opened the door for a multitude of operational benefits. This was a doctrine of the School of Offensive Operations.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_3_4_NAME;Deep Area Defense Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_3_4_DESC;The School of Defensive doctrine needed a new operational thinking to counter the increased mobility of the enemy. The Static Defense Doctrine had to be complemented to counter this threat. The answer lay in denying the enemy any maneuverability. This, it was thought, could be achieved by employing several layers of static fortified defenses. This would enable a defense in depth. Should the enemy break through the first defense, he would find himself pinned against the next one, unable to maneuver. This was a doctrine of the School of Defensive Operations.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_3_3_NAME;Combined Arms Warfare Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_3_3_DESC;The Combined Arms Warfare Doctrine was one of the most important doctrinal developments of the war. During the inter-war years, the army had been given a new tool: the tank. This tool, it was felt, could - and should - be a pivotal inventory on the battlefield. However, the views of how the tank was to be applied were many. Some doctrinal scholars and officers believed it should replace the cavalry. The tank should be employed on a platoon-basis and act as a reconnaissance force. Others believed the tank should be employed along with the infantry as a direct support tool. Still others believed the tank should be employed on a battalion and regimental level, and that specific tank formations should be developed. These formations would have an impact on the operational level rather than on the tactical level proposed by the supporters of the cavalry and infantry-support schools. These formations should then be the pivotal tool on the battlefield, not the tank in itself. This doctrine also proposed an increased mechanization of all other units and that different troops like infantry, artillery and air-support should be synchronized to function as a force of combined arms, the Combined Arms Warfare Doctrine. This was a doctrine of the School of Offensive Operations. The doctrine would be a cornerstone in the development of the Operational Maneuver Warfare Doctrine.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_3_2_NAME;Counter Artillery Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_3_2_DESC;With the development of the Counter-Battery Radar it was possible to track the shells of enemy artillery and calculate its position. This led to a series of actions and reactions, deployments and regrouping by the artillery as it struggled to maintain or obtain fire superiority. An increased number of fire missions were used for counter artillery missions, but the overall effectiveness of the fire support increased as it was possible to suppress and/or destroy the enemy artillery, thereby creating a favorable correlation of forces and means.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_3_1_NAME;Maneuver Artillery Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_3_1_DESC;The Maneuver Artillery Doctrine was developed as a result of the increased mobility of units and the increased tempo of operations. The deployed static artillery unit could not effectively support the forward battle area as it moved too rapidly for the artillery to keep up with it. The artillery was forced to create new equipment, new fire procedures, new organization and new training to allow the artillery to be effectively employed. This led to the creation of new mobile artillery units that could deploy faster. This was a doctrine of the school of offensive operations. The Maneuver Artillery Doctrine would be a cornerstone in the development of the Combined Arms Warfare Doctrine and the Self Propelled Artillery.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_2_4_NAME;Tactical Defensive Regimen;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_2_4_DESC;This regimen was developed through extensive field tests based on the experience drawn from World War I. The regimen defined combat operations procedures for sub-units. This was a regimen based on the school of defensive operations.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_2_3_NAME;Motorized HQs;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_2_3_DESC;The introduction of the motorized warfare doctrine demanded that formation command units could maneuver in conjunction the units under its command. This required a re-organization of the headquarters from a static command post to a semi-mobile command post. This led to a reform in command operations.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_2_2_NAME;Army Long-Range Reconnaissance Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_2_2_DESC;This doctrine was implemented from the need to identify and pinpoint the enemy main force and its positions for its encirclement and destruction. It was acknowledged that this had to be conducted by a special force specifically equipped and organized for the task. These became the first long-range reconnaissance formations. This was a doctrine of the School of Offensive Operations.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_2_1_NAME;Tactical Offensive Regimen;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_2_1_DESC;This regimen was developed through extensive field tests based on the experience drawn from World War I. The regimen defined combat operation procedures for sub-units. This was a regimen based on the School of Offensive Operations.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_1_4_NAME;Specialist Warfare Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_1_4_DESC;The Specialist Warfare Doctrine recognized the need for an optimization of formations earmarked for specific terrain and environmental conditions. The colonial possessions of many European nations meant that formations and personnel used to the temperate conditions would now have to operate in tropical, sub-tropical and arctic conditions. This doctrine internalized these needs into an organizational thinking that allowed for optimized equipment and training.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_1_3_NAME;Encirclement-Destruction Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_1_3_DESC;The Encirclement-Destruction Doctrine proposed that the enemy's main force be identified by probing and once identified it should be fixed while the unit main force encircled the enemy with the goal of destroying him. This doctrine changed previous thinking that the enemy main force be attacked by the entire unit force with the goal of repelling him from his defensive position rather than destroying him in it. This was a doctrine of the School of Offensive Operations.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_1_2_NAME;Motorized Warfare Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_1_2_DESC;The Motorized Warfare Doctrine effectively introduced a unit and sub-unit organization that could transport men and materials with motorized equipment like trucks and other haulers. This allowed a unit to move more rapidly than it had been able to previously. It also allowed it to carry far more equipment and supplies. The implementation of this doctrinal change of organization and equipment further allowed a unit to respond more quickly to enemy action. This was the first step towards the maneuver warfare and mechanization of the battlefield.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_1_1_NAME;Static Defense Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_LAND_DOC_1_1_DESC;The Static Defense Doctrine proposed that the best manner to defend territory against the enemy was to prepare strong defensive fortifications and perimeters in which infantry would defend supported by artillery. This doctrine did not emphasize the need for mobility, motorization or maneuver. Instead the shared weight of fortifications and obstacle preparations should slow, channel and finally halt the enemy advance. This was a doctrine of the School of Defensive Operations.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_L_AIR_9_9_NAME;Advanced LR Fighter Prototype Tests;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_L_AIR_9_9_DESC;The technological achievements in the fields of engine propulsion, airframe and aerodynamics could now be designed into an Advanced LR Fighter Prototype.

TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_6_2_NAME;Air Superiority Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_6_2_DESC;The Air Superiority Doctrine stipulated that an air force should exert its airpower to not only cover and defend specific targets, but to create a state of friendly air superiority in the entire theatre of operations. The air superiority would thereby effectively minimize the enemy air threat. The doctrine further stipulated that the air superiority should be achieved initially in advance of ground operations. Once superiority was achieved, objectives on the ground could be achieved decisively with minimal losses.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_6_1_NAME;Nuclear First Strike Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_6_1_DESC;The Nuclear First Strike Doctrine allowed a nation to use nuclear weapons preemptively. This doctrine was not a development of military operational thinking, but rather a political decision that was not lightly taken. Opponents of the first strike doctrine argued that it would forfeit the user's moral authority in the conflict, while the proponents argued that it would save lives as it would end the conflict rapidly.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_5_4_NAME;Airborne Invasion Organization;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_5_4_DESC;The Airborne Invasion Organization allowed for the organization of troops and the development of technology for a large scale airborne invasion. This meant broadening the scope of the operation and giving it higher goals to attain. A large specialized supply organization and special detachments must be formed in order to conduct an airborne invasion.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_5_3_NAME;Terror Bombing Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_5_3_DESC;The Terror Bombing Doctrine was built on the technique of the Carpet Bombing Doctrine. However, it did not target the enemy's industrial complex but rather the civilian population and the nation's will to fight. It was employed with great success against civilian population centers utilizing fuel explosives to create firestorms in the target. This doctrine yielded very high civilian casualties for the enemy and was effective in eliminating the enemy's resolve to fight.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_5_2_NAME;Close Air Support Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_5_2_DESC;The Close Air Support Doctrine was a further development of the Air-Land Battle Doctrine. Previously the unit commander had directed the air support from the command post, now the ground commander on the forward edge of the battle area could direct the air support directly. It gave airpower a role as a highly mobile reserve for the ground units.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_5_1_NAME;Wingman Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_5_1_DESC;The Wingman Doctrine replaced the Combat Training Team Doctrine. The Wingman Doctrine further minimized the number of aircraft to be closely coordinated in air combat. This doctrine stipulated that aircraft be coordinated in groups of two aircraft with one of them the senior leader. The other aircraft would support the first and act as a guard. This doctrine required a high level of training of pilots, but proved very effective in air combat. It was the forerunner of doctrines for air combat today in modern times.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_4_3_NAME;Bomb-Runner Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_4_3_DESC;The Bomb-Runner Doctrine allowed a strategic bomber equipped with a radar navigation device to lead an entire air unit onto the target area. The aircraft equipped with the radar navigation device, called 'Bomb-Runnner' by the British, would lead the air unit in formation to the target and release the bomb load. This would signal the rest of the air unit and the bombing of the target would be synchronized. This doctrine was related to the Radar Scout Doctrine in that it was developed from a need to utilize the radar equipment optimally.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_4_2_NAME;Radar Scout Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_4_2_DESC;With the development of effective airborne radars it was possible for the air unit to attain information about the enemy without the assistance of the ground. Not only was the airborne radar technically superior to the radar warning sites, but it also cut the time it took to relay the information. Airborne radar however was very expensive and difficult to operate. It was recognized that they could not be installed in all aircraft. The Radar Scout Doctrine allowed for one aircraft in the air unit, or the combat training team, to be equipped with an airborne radar, allowing that aircraft to relay information about the enemy to other aircraft via radio.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_4_1_NAME;Air-Land Battle Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_4_1_DESC;The Air-Land Battle Doctrine stipulated that the air force be optimally suited to function in conjunction with ground forces. This meant a coordination of command and communications had to take place. This doctrine viewed the airpower as an indirect fire tool to be used as a complement to artillery for ground commanders. These components should be brought to bear on the enemy with a synergetic effect. This doctrine was a result of the Combined Arms Warfare Doctrine and the theories of force concentration.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_3_5_NAME;Area Anti-Air Defense Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_3_5_DESC;The Area Anti-Air Defense Doctrine did not replace the Point Anti-Air Defense Doctrine, rather it complemented it. Air defenses were still concentrated at key points per the Point Anti-Air Defense Doctrine, but they where complemented by a new form of area defenses. These area defenses were made up of several battalion-sized squares that were coordinated centrally. These squares, called 'Grossbatterien' by the Germans, where positioned to form a network or maze into which the enemy bombers had to fly. The network was changed regularly so that the enemy could not maneuver around it.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_3_4_NAME;Vertical Envelopment Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_3_4_DESC;The Airborne Assault Doctrine allowed for entire units to be para-dropped. The Vertical Envelopment Doctrine allowed for units to be para-dropped over an enemy controlled area of operations, a so-called opposed para-drop. While previous air and land doctrines had recognized the need to envelop the enemy on a two-dimensional level, the Vertical Envelopment Doctrine allowed for a three-dimensional envelopment of the enemy. While land units could encircle and envelop the enemy on the ground, paratroops could be launched against the enemy to create a flank from above to create further pressure on the enemy. It was a risky doctrine and the operations often yielded high levels of casualties, but used properly it was a tremendous tool.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_3_3_NAME;Mechanized Airborne Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_3_3_DESC;The Mechanized Airborne Doctrine recognized the potential of the Airborne Tank and implemented its use in airborne operations. The Airborne Tank was transported by glider and could begin operating immediately after landing. The Mechanized Airborne Doctrine stipulated that the Airborne Tank be used primarily as a reconnaissance vehicle to allow for the expansion of the paratroop division's area of operations. But it could also operate as tactical reserve for the division commander.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_3_2_NAME;Carpet Bombing Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_3_2_DESC;The Carpet Bombing Doctrine stipulated that large formations of strategic bomber units be coordinated to deliver their bomb loads over large areas. This doctrine allowed for the destruction of a large designated area. The carpet bombing would target the enemy's industrial complexes from a high altitude.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_3_1_NAME;Combat Training Team Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_3_1_DESC;The Combat Training Team Doctrine replaced the 'Flying Circus' Doctrine. With the introduction of radio communications between individual aircraft it was possible to retain a higher level of coordination. It proved inefficient to coordinate entire fighter wings or squadrons in air combat, and it also proved to be an ineffective way of developing experienced fighter pilots. This new doctrine instead stipulated that aircraft be coordinated in groups of up to five aircraft including a senior experienced pilot, two experienced pilots and two junior pilots. The senior experienced pilot would train the other group members and lead them in air operations. When the pilots became more experienced and gained in seniority they would leave the team and create a new team under their command. A squadron or wing was made up of several such teams.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_2_2_NAME;Sheltered Airfields Organization;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_2_2_DESC;As more focus was shifted towards destroying the enemy's airpower by attacking his airbases it became increasingly important to protect those facilities, and most importantly the aircraft on the ground. With the introduction and implementation of hardened aircraft shelters the aircraft retained a high degree of protection against enemy airfield attacks.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_2_1_NAME;Home Chain Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_2_1_DESC;With the development of effective radar warning sites it became possible for a ground command station to direct the airborne aircraft to their targets. Previously airborne aircraft had to patrol and detect the enemy visually. Now they could be directed and coordinated with a vastly improved precision and speed. The airborne warning sites, called 'Home Chain' by the British, relayed information to the air unit command and control facility which relayed the information to the airborne air unit.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_1_4_NAME;Point Anti-Air Defense Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_1_4_DESC;The Point Anti-Air Defense Doctrine recognized the need to protect certain key industries and facilities against air attack. This doctrine stipulated that air defenses should be concentrated at these key points and coordinated centrally for increased effectiveness.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_1_3_NAME;Airborne Assault Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_1_3_DESC;The Airborne Assault Training had allowed for sub-units to be para-dropped into an area of operations. The Airborne Assault Doctrine allowed for entire units to be para-dropped. This allowed for the paratroop division to function as a highly maneuverable and transportable strategic reserve. The unit would be para-dropped over the area of operations and proceed overland to conduct combat operations.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_1_2_NAME;Blitz Bombing Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_1_2_DESC;As airframe design improved it was possible to construct aircraft that could endure steep dives at high speeds. This new technology allowed an aircraft to deliver a bomb from a vertical rather than a horizontal attack angle. This increased the bombing precision many fold, and it also made for a minimal exposure to ground fire. The implementation of this new technology into the Dive-Bomber and its use was the cornerstone of the 'Blitz' Bombing Doctrine. The doctrine called for the Dive-Bomber to be used as direct-support for ground units. The dive-bomber became a complement to the artillery for ground commanders.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_1_1_NAME;Flying Circus Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_APP_AIR_DOC_1_1_DESC;The 'Flying Circus' Doctrine was the first doctrine for fighter unit combat. The doctrine centered around the air unit, either a squadron or a wing. The essence of the doctrine was that the air unit should function as a combat unit in air operations. While radio communications between individual aircraft was still rare, the coordination of operations had to take place through hand signals and other visual means. The air unit was lead by the squadron or wing commander, often a so called 'Ace' with extensive combat experience. The junior members of the unit had to learn the ropes by watching the actions of senior members of the unit. Air combat should be concluded decisively by the air unit, often known as a 'Flying Circus', through the initiative of the unit leader, and the remaining number of aircraft in the unit should be used to overwhelm the enemy and force pursuit.;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_ALL;Allows:;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_AIR_DOC_NAME;Air Warfare Doctrines;;;;;;;;;;X
TECH_AIR_DOC_DESC;A military doctrine can be described as a paradigmatic solution to certain formulated problems of war. It defines the goal, the means and the operational procedures of the combat, the doctrine may define these issues in the scope of strategic, operational and tactical operations. The field of doctrines is at least as important as a nation's gains in technological research. An air force equipped with the latest equipment will be defeated by an enemy with a more advanced doctrinal approach to combat. It is also very important for a nation to make decisions on whether to develop a defensive or offensive doctrine since it will be costly to maintain two doctrines.;;;;;;;;;;X

TAN_DESC;Tannu Tuva has long been involved in a complicated relationship between Russia and China.  First occupied by Dzhungar Khan Galdan in 1688, the land came under Mongol rule.  In 1758 when Dzhungaria was defeated by the Chinese the territory was under the dominion of Manchuria. During the middle 19th century, because of mutual interest of Tannu Tuva and Russia, the Tuvans began to allow Russian merchants to trade duty free.  In the late 1800s tensions rose as the Tuvans began a series of rebellions against their rulers. Ofter the fall of the Tsin Empire in China Tannu Tuva moved to liberate itself from Chinese rule.  Knowing that as a small and weak nation they could not expect to remain independence they sought the protection of Russia, becoming a Russian protectorate in 1914.  After the Russian Revolution the Attorney of the Siberian revolutionary committee of RSFSR I.G. Safianov declared that 'Now the Soviet government considers Uryankhai (Tuva) independent as before' and in August 1921, the Peoples Republic of Tannu Tuva was formed.  The small nation in the center of Asia was primarily an agrarian society with little industry (mostly coal and gold mining).  The nation also maintained close ties with the Soviet government.;;;;;;;;;;X

SWE_DESC;In 1818 Karl XIV Johann was crowned the first king of the still ruling house of Bernadotte. Neutrality became the guideline of Swedish foreign policy from then on. Even though Oskar I (1844 - 1859) supported Denmark in her first war against the German League (1848 - 1850) Sweden insisted on its neutrality during the Crimean War (1853 - 1856) and the 2nd German-Danish War of 1864 which allowed for the country's unhindered development into a parliamentary democracy. In 1865/66 a bicameral system was introduced and a Liberal cabinet was established in 1905. In 1909 Gustav V (1907 - 1950) acknowledged universal suffrage for the Second Chamber of parliament, eventually making Sweden a constitutional monarchy. The union with Norway broke in 1905, defeating the idea of a pan-Scandinavian state which had been envisioned by Karl XV (1859 - 1872). During World War I (1914 - 1918) Sweden remained neutral and became the starting point of many peace efforts, particularly from the socialist side. The Social Democrats became the strongest party in 1920 and formed the government numerous times till 1936. Under the impact of the Great Depression which reached Sweden in 1931/32 even the highly advanced Swedish agriculture and industry suffered. A welfare state was created which became a role model for most of Western Europe.;;;;;;;;;;X

Separatist movements like those of the Basques or the Catalans gained support, the church interfered in politics, and a radical workers movement destabilized the balance between conservatives and liberals. After taking the government in 1902 Alfons XIII showed expansionist tendencies as demonstrated by the intervention in Morocco. The Algeciras Act of 1906 did acknowledge Spanish interests in Morocco, institutionalized by a protectorate over the north and south of the African country in 1912, but it became a source of permanent unrest. During World War I Spain remained neutral. After 1918 the social tensions erupted in a number of revolts by the rural populace and right wing as well as anarchistic factions. Alfons XIII supported the military coup against the government by General Miguel Primo de Rivera who abolished the constitution of 1876 and installed a dictatorial rule between 1923 and 1930. He ended the uprising in Morocco with a victory over Abd el-Krim in 1926, but could not master the economic crisis and had to resign after repeated revolts by the military and students. In 1931 Alfons XIII also abdicated and allowed the Liberal Conservative Niceto Alcal· Zamora y Torres the proclamation of the Second Republic. The republic, however, could not overcome the deep rift between the factions of the Spanish society, reaching from fascist Falangists to monarchists, conservative liberals, left liberals, socialists, communists and Anarcho-Syndicalists.

In 1939 Franco achieved - supported militarily by both Germany and Italy - victory over the People's Front who had been favored by the USSR and Mexico and who had signed up the aid of the International Brigades of Republicans, Socialists, and Communists from all over the world. After the victory Franco established an authoritarian regime with a constitution patterned for him as 'Caudillo' (leader). The Falange movement became the party to secure his domestic power. Despite advances from Hitler, Franco declined all offers for an alliance with the Axis during the war and only detached the Blue Division of volunteers to the campaign in Russia.;;;;;;;;;;X

SOV_DESC;No other nation suffered such domestic political turmoil as Russia during the Great War, which saw the ancient throne of the Romanov Tsars toppled and the vast empire of Peter the Great and Alexander II fall into the hands of a mass revolutionary movement, the Bolshevik Marxists of Vladimir Illych Lenin. Renamed the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), the country was rededicated to the spread of revolutionary communist ideology across the world, making it a pariah amongst the decadent capitalist economies of Europe. After Leninís death and a series of behind-the-scenes intrigues, his lieutenant Josef Stalin emerged as the heir to the Bolshevik legacy. By a ferocious policy of industrialization and an equally uncompromising attitude towards political foes, Stalin has by 1936 consolidated his position as supreme ruler of the USSR and returned the once-battered and ignored Russian state to the diplomatic table as a major power. But many strategic dilemmas haunt him. Should Russia seek to expand into the lost territories of Eastern Europe, or strike southwards to the blue waters of the Indian Ocean? Can a deal be brokered with the British and French - or even Hitler and Mussolini? What of the Japanese and their designs?;;;;;;;;;;X
SOV_41_DESC;When Molotov brokered his surprise deal with his German counterpart von Ribbentrop in the summer of 1939, few observers expected the unnatural partnership between the Nazis and the Soviets to last for long. Indeed, Stalin saw the non-aggression treaty as a breathing space which he could use to build up his military forces and expand his territorial buffer zone in Eastern Europe. But while the USSR took over the Baltic States and large parts of Romania without difficulty, Finland's stubborn resistance against overwhelming Russian opposition in the 'Winter War' of 1939-1940 humiliated the Red Army: and Germany's faster-than-expected triumph in France left Stalin's timetable of rearmament lagging dangerously behind. In June 1941, Hitler finally abandoned his distasteful dÈtente with the 'Bolshevik' enemy and attacked the USSR in a massive continent-wide onslaught that left hundreds of thousands of Russian troops surrounded and broken. The Soviets retreated as best they could, doggedly resisting everywhere, but their army was clearly incapable of holding back the initial German torrent. Only the arrival of the September rains and winter snow finally stalled the Wehrmacht. As December arrives, welcome new has come from the Far East: with Japan now engaged against the British and Americans, the Russians can safely transfer their Siberian forces to defend Moscow and spearhead a long-awaited counter-attack. But Russia's position remains critical, and Stalin will need all his reserves of peasant cunning to overcome the crisis.;;;;;;;;;;X

But whether this artificial peace can be sustained for long is questionable. And never forget Japan, far to the East.;;;;;;;;;;X

SLO_DESC;Seeing the continuing discrimination of their people under the double monarchy of Austria-Hungary Slovakian politicians and intellectuals were convinced that only joining with the Czechs would lead the way out of their national misery. Representatives of immigrated Slovaks in the U.S.A. agreed with the Czech nationalists Thom·s Garrigue Masaryk and Eduard Benes on a united state of the Czechs and the Slovaks. This new country was proclaimed as independent republic by the name of Czechoslovakia in Prague in 1918. After over 1000 years of foreign rule the Slovaks, making up around 30 percent of the total Czechoslovakian population lived together with the Czechs as equals in an autonomous state. But soon unrest stirred about the predominance of the Czechs which found, among others, its expression in the establishing of centralized structures. Main power of the anti-Czech resistance was the catholic conservative Slovakian People's Party (SPP), calling for extensive autonomy. When after the Munich Treaty of 1938 Czechoslovakia ceded the Sudeten regions to Germany the SPP seized the opportunity and exploited the acute weakness of the government in Prague and achieved a federalization of Czechoslovakia. In March 1939 Germany broke the Munich Treaty and occupied the Czech part of the country, turning it into the 'Reichsprotektorat Bˆhmen und M‰hren' (Protectorate Bohemia and Moravia). A day earlier, by call of Adolf Hitler, Slovakia had declared her independence. Formally independent, Slovakia was de facto a vassal of Germany, although the new country was recognized by 25 states, among the Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. The government of Prime Minister Jozef Tisos, a catholic priest, followed under close watch from Berlin a conservative authoritarian policy.;;;;;;;;;;X

SIK_DESC;Sinkiang played a crucial role in the The Great Game between the region's major powers, located as it was between Russia and British India. Both powers soon became active in trading in the province, although the Manchus had imposed a ban on European trade in the area. According to a Soviet source, 'the British, with their record in India, were the more dreaded of the two, and Peking lived in constant fear of intrigue in East Turkestan by these inveterate colonizers.' However, despite British efforts, Russia eventually gained the upper hand in the area. As a result of a number of the 'unequal treaties' which China was forced to sign with the Western powers after the Opium Wars, specifically the Ili Treaty (1851), the Tacheng Protocol of the Treaty of Peking (1860), and the Treaty of Tarbagatai (1864), China had to surrender nearly 350,000 square miles of territory to Russia, as well as giving the Russians special trading privileges and the right to station consuls in the area. At the same time, China suffered massive territorial losses to the Russians in Manchuria. China's weakened state as a result of the Taiping Rebellion (1850-64), the second Opium War (1857-60), and Muslim Rebellions in Yunnan (1855-1873) and Shaanxi (1862-1873) set the stage for the next phase in the Game. Between 1864 and 1877, the Muslims in Sinkiang revolted and set up an independent state, which came to be known as 'Kashgaria,' under the leadership of the Kokand adventurer Yaqub Beg, who attempted to maintain good relations with both Britain and Russia, in hopes that they would be able to protect him against the inevitable Chinese attempt to once again bring the area and its inhabitants under the control of the Qing dynasty. Under these unstable conditions, the Russians proceeded to annex the Ili Valley in 1870-71, giving as their reason the need to maintain law and order in this area adjacent to their newly-conquered territory in Russian Turkestan. In 1877, Yaqub Beg was defeated by the Chinese general Zuo Zongtang. However, the 'Ili Crisis' lasted until 1881, when the Treaty of St. Petersburg was signed, resulting in the return of most of the annexed territory to China, although Russia kept some of it and China had to pay indemnities to her and allow her to open up more consulates in the area. In 1884, Sinkiang officially became a province of China. However, the drive for independence remained, and in 1933 an Independent Republic of Eastern Turkestan was formed in Kashgar.';;;;;;;;;;X

Many territorial claims in Malaysia still remained to be settled, however. With France brought to its knees by Germany, Siam would use Japanese mediation to regain territory which had been ceded to France in 1893, including western Cambodia and all of Laos west of the Mekong River. Just hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Siam granted Japan the right to cross through the country on their way to the Malaysian frontier. Siam was now, effectively, an ally of the Japanese Empire, a fact that would be made official in a matter of weeks.;;;;;;;;;;X

SCH_DESC;The Swiss Confederation saw crisis in 19th century. In several cantons liberal powers prevailed, calling for more democracy and more centralism. This met the opposition of the catholic, conservatively dominated cantons who formed the Sonderbund in 1845. The Sonderbund War erupted in 1847 which saw the liberals as victors. In 1848 a Federal Constitution was ratified, turning the loose league of cantons into a Federal State with a new federal capital in Bern. The new constitution created new institutions like the (Bundesrat) Federal Council, Bundesversammlung (Federal Assembly), and Bundesgericht (Federal Court). Switzerland remained neutral during World War I, although there were various domestic conflicts between German and French speaking Swiss citizens. In addition economical problems arose, completely surrounded as the country was by warring nations. The radical left gained a lot of support during that time, and in 1918 a strike called for by the workers movement attempted to push through major social changes. The attempt failed, but in its wake social reforms were begun, bringing about higher wages and shorter work days. In 1919 the system of proportional representation was introduced. The conservative Freisinnige lost their majority while the social democrats grew stronger. Into the 1930s the domestic politics were governed by the conflict between social democrats and conservatives. Switzerland joined the League of Nations in 1920 despite the resistance efforts by conservatives and Swiss friendly towards Germany. The integral, unconditional neutrality was replaced by the differentiating neutrality. The London Declaration permitted Switzerland to deny the support of military sanctions.;;;;;;;;;;X

SAU_DESC;The center of the Arabian Peninsula became the starting point for the Wahhabite state in 1744. Fo Muhammad ibn Abd-al Wahh‚b both the Shiite Islam of the Ottoman Empire and the Sunnite Islam of the Persians were distortions of the true Muslim faith. In alliance with Muhammad Ibn Saud the Wahhabites conquered all the tribes of Arabia in an offensive that would last decades. After the death of Abd-al Wahh‚b the Saudis ruled the larger part of the peninsula, conquering Mekka in 1806 and threatening Syria. Mohammed Ali, Ottoman governor in Egypt crushed the first Saudi state in 1818 by order of the Sultan. But already in 1824 a new principality under Saudi government was forming. The Wahhabiyya remained an important religious and political power in Arabia. In 1843 an attempt to restore the Wahhabite state was foiled by quarrels between tribes and the Ottoman intervention of 1884. The last Saud fled to Kuwait in 1891. From there Aziz ibn Saud (1902 - 1953) managed to found a new Wahhabite country. 1902 he conquered Ryad and made her his capital. He had to submit to an Ottoman military expedition in 1905, but he kept the status of a vassal. In the Saudi-Ottoman treaty of 1914 he received the province of Nadshd as hereditary property. After the British-Saudi protection treaty of 1915 Ibn Saud remained quiet. The active role in the fight against the Turks was taken by the Heshamites of the Hedjaz. Sherif Hussein who proclaimed himself 'King of the Arabian Lands' after the Turks had been driven from Medina became the main rival in the struggle for power. However, after the World War I the Hashemites were expelled from the Hedjaz by the Saudis in 1924 and in 1927 Ibn Saud was crowned 'King of Nadshd, Hedjaz, and her Protectorates'. In 1932 he became ruler of the newly founded Saudi-Arabia. Becoming the custodians of the Holy Places of Islam gave the Saudis both an important legitimation of their authority and high revenues from pilgrimages. However, economic setbacks due to the Great Depression forced the to open their country for U.S. oil concessions. Nevertheless, the oil wells discovered in 1936 would not become economically important until over a decade later.';;;;;;;;;;X

SAL_DESC;Since its declaration of independence from Spain in 1821, El Salvador has been sharply divided between liberal and conservative factions that would leave it as disunited as most of the other Central American states. Despite several abandoned attempts to create a federal state with the other Central American countries, El Salvador has remained independent and easily influenced by foreign powers. Indeed, one of the most powerful influences in its history has been the foreign owned coffee industry. A drastic fall in the price of coffee during the great depression would lead to a minor communist insurrection in 1932. In reaction to this insurrection the military seized power and launched a series of reprisals that would claim the lives of over 20,000 Salvadorans. The new President, General Maximiliano Hernandez Martinez would launch a program that can only be described as limited liberalization combined with absolute repression. Though Martinez would never take on the elites of Salvadoran society, he did institute limited land reform and social welfare. A fervent anti-communist, he was sympathetic to the fascist cause, but also deeply aware that the US is much, much closer. The Generalissimo was also known for his spiritualism, which culminated in his stringing lights through San Salvador in an effort to ward off an epidemic of smallpox.;;;;;;;;;;X

SAF_DESC;For thousands of years South Africa has been populated by two distinct cultural groups: the hunter gatherer San (Bushmen) and the agrarian Khoikhoi (Hottentots). These communities were irretrievably shattered by the arrival, in 1652, of Dutch bases on the cape, which were quickly followed by settlements. The Khoikhoi were soon reduced to forced labor for the settlers and for the Dutch East India Company, with rights often much less than that of slaves in the Americas. After the British took control of the colony during the Napoleonic Wars several attempts were made to alleviate the plight of the Khoikhoi, with limited success. Either way the liberal policies of the British led to large numbers of Dutch Voortrekkers to head north and establish their own republics on still more Khoikhoi land. The interior of South Africa would remain largely unsettled by whites, however, well into the 19th century. This would all change upon the discovery of vast diamond and gold deposits in the area. The influx of British prospectors would soon lead to increasingly violent confrontations between British colonials and Boer Republicans. The period also saw the final, violent repression of the last remaining free chiefdoms in South Africa. An attempt at a federal system incorporating both the colonies and the Boer republics was shattered by a Boer victory over the British at Majuba in 1881. The resulting Anglo-Boer War, which raged from 1899-1902, would lead to an annexation of the Boer republics. The Boers, however, would win the peace, creating a constitution that ensured the retention of white-only rule in South Africa. White Afrikaners still, however, held a great deal of resentment towards the British Empire. Though an agreement was made with the Crown in 1926 which ensured that South Africa would remain part of the Commonwealth, a great deal of the population still opposes this measure.;;;;;;;;;;X

Upon the outbreak of war in 1939, Prime Minister JBM Hertzog tried unsuccessfully to keep South Africa neutral. The nationalistic opposition to the war, headed by Dr DF Malan, has been steadily growing since South Africa's entry, though so far they have kept the movement nonviolent and purely political.;;;;;;;;;;X

ROM_DESC;In the Peace of Paris, concluding the Crimean War (1853 - 1856), the unification of Moldavia and Walachia into the Principality Romania was decided. Ioan Alexandru Cuza became the first Prince (1859 - 1866), to be followed onto the throne by Karl von Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen (1866 - 1914). After the 8th Russian-Turkish War 1877/78, which saw Romania fighting alongside Russia, the country's sovereignty was recognized at the Berlin Congress of 1878. Southern Bessarabia was ceded to Russia, while Romania gained Dobrudja. In 1881 the Romanian Prince took the title of King Karl I. The orientation towards the West was secured while Russian influence lost its appeal. Karl I settled the Second Balkan War (1913) and joined the Calibrater with Dobrudja. His successor Ferdinand (1914 - 1927) became King of All Romanians.  With the outbreak of World War I in 1914 Romania initially remained neutral, but would join the Entente in 1916. The Middle Powers were unable to occupy the country and signed the peace of Bucharest in 1918. The collapse of the Habsburg and Romanov monarchies saved Romania from the ratification of that peace treaty. Romanians in Transylvania and Bukovina decided to unify with the Romanian state, an act that was internationally recognized in the Paris Peace Treaties of 1920. Their political ties to the West, however, were thwarted by the state's behavior. After the death of King Ferdinand I, six year old Michael I, whose father Karl II had given up his royal heritage because of an affair with the commoner Elena Lupescu, rose to the throne. In 1930, nevertheless, Karl II returned from Paris to climb the throne. The major powers were keeping a close watch on the country and her rich oil reserves, however.;;;;;;;;;;X

He reigned until 1940 when, as a consequence of the Hitler-Stalin Pact and the Vienna Arbitration, Northwestern Transylvania went to Hungary, the Northern Bukovina and Bessarabia to Russia, and Southern Dobrudja to Bulgaria. Michael I returned to the throne, but the government appointed General Ion Antonescu as State Leader. In 1941 Romania joined the German attack against the Soviet Union, her troops driving into Bukovina and Bessarabia.;;;;;;;;;;X

PRU_DESC;Although factually independent since 1821, Spain only recognized the autonomy of her former colony in 1871 when a peace between the countries was struck after a conflict between the two countries over the Chinchain Islands. An alliance with Bolivia drew the country into a border conflict between Chile and Bolivia in the Atacama Desert (Saltpeter War). During the war Peru lost her provinces of Tarapac·, Arica, and Tacna. British and U.S. financial circles exploited the opportunity, stripping the weakened Peruvian state of their state railroad, nullifying Peru's debts in exchange. Between 1895 and 1930 the domestic situation was consolidated. Newly discovered copper deposits made up for the loss of the Saltpeter provinces for which Peru was compensated in the Treaty of Lima in 1929, getting free port access to Arica, receiving back the province of Tacna, and $6 million. With the Great Depression and the subsequent fall of President LeguÌas the climate in domestic politics grew colder. The socialist APRA (Allianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana, founded in 1924) under Victor Ra˙l Haya de la Torre demanded a land reform and the political and social integration of the Indios who made up 50 percent of the population. In 1931 and 1936 Haya de la Torre failed in the elections. The successes of his party, however, alarmed the military under Oscar Raimundo Benavides who banned the party.;;;;;;;;;;X

POR_DESC;The struggles between republicans and supporters of a constitutional monarchy were characteristic for 19th century Portugal, causing a deep rift in the country. In 1910 a coup of Portuguese republican officers against King Emanuel II brought the rule of the Braganca. TeÛfilo Fernandes Braga became first president of the republic. He proclaimed the civil liberties and emancipated women in family law. An agricultural reform failed, however, because of the opposition of the aristocracy. The gravest heritage of the republic was the desolate economy which was completely oriented towards trade with Great Britain. The inner conflict caused the quick change of eight presidents and forty-four governments till 1926. World War I, which Portugal joined on the side of the Entente, made matters worse. The merchant marine suffered heavy losses from the German U-Boats, and the trade with the colonies collapsed. The situation escalated with two military coup attempts in 1926 during which the republican constitution was abolished. General AntÛnio Oscar de Fragoso Carmona took the reigns of the government and was confirmed in office through elections held in 1928. He founded the Second Republic which he would lead in authoritarian fashion for decades to come. AntÛnio Oliveira Salazar became his minister of finances. In 1932 Salazar became prime minister and established a system after the fascist pattern.;;;;;;;;;;X

POL_DESC;Until the end of the Great War, there was no Poland. What had been Polish territory had been carved up between Austria, Russia, and Prussia at the end of the 18th century, and in the face of scattered uprisings throughout the 19th those three nations continued to hold on to their Polish territory. By 1918, however, the Poles found themselves in the uniquely fortuitous position of having all of their former subjugators collapse around them as Russia fell into revolution while Germany and Austria were defeated by the Allies. Not wasting any time, the Polish leader Jozef Pilsudski declared an independent Poland on 11th November 1918, and after a bitter war to hold off the newly formed Soviet state, Poland was officially a free nation. Though it had lost it's democratic regime to a coup in 1926, Poland was prospering by 1936, with the standard of living improving, unemployment falling, and the economy recovering nicely. Yet, Poland's fate seems increasingly uncertain as it finds itself sandwiched between Soviet Russia and a resurgent Germany, both of which would enjoy seeing Poland disappear from the map.;;;;;;;;;;X

PHI_DESC;The Philippines had not achieved full independence from American control in 1936, but they were closer to it. The Tydings-McDuffie Act had been passed in 1934, creating the Commonwealth of the Philippines with an elected government under Manuel Quezon and a constitution based upon that of the United States. While technically an independent state, the United States retained control of the foreign affairs and military until 4th July 1946, when the Commonwealth of the Philippines would become the Republic of the Philippines and achieve true independence. Yet, though they could not be seen quite so clearly at the start of 1936, storm clouds were building and the status of the Philippines as an American protectorate could have dire consequences for the country's future....;;;;;;;;;;X

PER_DESC;For nearly two centuries Persia, known to its people as Iran, has been precariously balanced between conflicting forces. Internally the elements of reform and westernization conflict with an increasingly conservative clergy. Internationally Persia was split, in 1907, into a Russian northern sphere and a British south, although it would never be a formal colony of either power. After several attempts at a constitutional monarchy in the first decades of the 20th Century, Persia was thrown into social, political, and economic chaos. Reza Khan, an army officer, finally staged a successful coup against the corrupt Qajar Dynasty in 1921. Though the intent was originally to proclaim a republic, pressure from the conservative clergy (who feared being left out of any republican power structure) convinced now Prime Minister Reza Khan to crown himself Reza Shah Pahlavi. Strongly authoritarian and nationalistic, Reza Shah soon began a vigorous program of industrialization and secular reform, establishing universities, improving infrastructure, establishing public education, and reducing the influence of the mullahs, thereby laying the foundations for a modern, secular Iranian state. Just as important as modernization and secularizing, however, was his determination that Persia maintain its independence in the face of Soviet expansion and British interests in his country's oil reserves. Perhaps the solution is a third force which could free Persia from Soviet and British influence?;;;;;;;;;;X

PAR_DESC;Dictator JosÈ Gasparo Rodriguez (1811/14 - 1840) preserved Paraguay's integrity against Argentinean and Brazilian claims through a self-sufficient economy and cutting off his country politically. His nephew and successor, Carlos Antonio LÛpez (1844 - 1862) opened the country again to promote the economic and cultural development. Under his son, Francisco Solano LÛpez (1862 - 1870), these efforts ended abruptly when he attempted to secure access to a port militarily. This led to the devastating war against the Triple Alliance of Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay (1865 - 1870) in which Paraguay lost a quarter of her territory and more than half its population. After the death of LÛpez in 1870 the national assembly enacted a liberal constitution. 1887 saw the establishment of the Liberal Party and the conservative AsociaciÛn Nacional Republicana (Colorado). After many revolts and coup d'Ètats the situation calmed under Eligio Ayala (1924 - 1928). After the costly Chaco War against Bolivia (1932 - 1935) which gave the larger part of the Chaco Boreal to Paraguay a number of authoritarian regimes ruled the country.;;;;;;;;;;X

PAN_DESC;The history of the nation of Panama is irretrievably linked with its most famous feature: the Panama Canal. After the Columbian government resisted American attempts to build a canal through the Panamanian Isthmus, the United States encouraged the Panamanians to rise up against the Columbians then prevented the Columbians from crossing into Panama to put the insurrection down. The Panamanian declaration of independence was written in New York City and created Panama as a de-facto protectorate of the United States. Suffering, as most Western countries, from the Great Depression, Panamanian objections to non-canal related American commerce in the Canal Zone putting native industry out of business led to a new treaty in early 1936. The new treaty would lessen the United States' special rights in the Canal Zone, while still allowing for unilateral military action on the part of the United States in Panama if the United States found it necessary. While still firmly in the grip of the United States, these measures may not be able to still the budding tides of Panamanian anti-Yankee nationalism.;;;;;;;;;;X

OMN_DESC;When Ahmad Al Bu Sa'id rose to power in 1749, Oman began an age of expansion. For about a hundred years Great Britain tolerated their sea trading empire which reached from the coasts of East Africa as far as China. Slave trading and the export of spices were the primary sources of income. Between 1789 and 1805 rivalries for the throne between factions within the Al Sa'id dynasty foreshadowed Oman's demise. More and more it came under the influence of the British Empire without ever becoming a formal colony. During this feud, Muscat on the sea formed a sultanate while the inner country became a religiously oriented imamate. The growing dominance of the British increased the political and economic dependency of Oman. Not only had they lost the rich island of Zanzibar to the British, in exchange for which they received the ZanZibar Subsidy, but the opening of the Suez Canal and the prohibition of slave and weapons trade had completely crippled their economy.;;;;;;;;;;X

NZL_DESC;New Zealand was granted its dominion status in 1907, and since then has remained linked closely both with it's mother country Britain and it's larger neighbor Australia. In fact, New Zealand's experiences mirrored those of Australia in many ways, New Zealanders served in the ANZAC (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps), and fought with great distinction from Flanders to Gallipoli to Egypt and Turkey. As a result, they took disproportionate casualties for such a small nation, with over 18,000 of an original overseas force of 100,000 killed in action. Nevertheless, they earned a reputation for ferocity in battle which has never faded. By the 1930s, the Great Depression hit New Zealand's economy hard, with export prices plummeting and lay-offs souring. By 1935, despite the best efforts of the National Party to remedy the situation, New Zealand's economy was in shambles and the Labor party was brought to power as a result. New Zealand is by no means ready for war in 1936, but if it comes, like her larger neighbor, her soldiers can be counted on to support Britain.;;;;;;;;;;X
NZL_41_DESC;By 1941, the soldiers of New Zealand have fought alongside their Australian comrades throughout the Mediterranean, first facing defeat in Greece and Creek, then a brief taste of victory in North Africa, followed by more defeat at the hands of Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps. The Anzacs have fought bravely, but the German army has so far outfought and outmaneuvered the soldiers of the British Commonwealth, and now they must adapt if they are to turn the tide of the war. The entry of Japan into the conflict has put a new spin on New Zealand's war. For the first time, the island nation is itself threatened with potential invasion, should Japan's campaign succeed in pushing the Allies back through the South Pacific. With the sinking of Force Z, Britain's naval strength is crippled, and so far the Japanese have made stunningly rapid advances down the Malayan peninsula. Whatever the troubles of Europe may have been previously, New Zealand may be about to discover that this is indeed a world at war....;;;;;;;;;;X

Yet, the effects of the depression still lingered when war was declared on 3rd September 1939.

NOR_DESC;For centuries Norway had been part of the Danish realm until Denmark had to cede it - without Iceland or Greenland - to Sweden in the Peace of Kiel. An attempt of the Norwegians to proclaim independence from their Swedish neighbor was foiled by a military intervention by King Karl XIII. However, the Swedish king allowed his new subjects internal autonomy by recognizing their constitution. Tensions between the parliament (Storting) and the king in Sweden escalated in the 1870. Under leadership of the liberal left (Venstre) the country turned into parliamentary monarchy in 1884 with universal suffrage after 1898 (till 1913 only for men). With Norway's rise as a trading power in the 19th century came claims to install consulates in other countries. Resistance by Sweden against this claim caused the end of the Union between the countries in 1905. The Danish prince Karl was elected King Haakon VII. Despite British demands Norway remained neutral during World War I, even though it lost half its merchant marine to Germany's unrestricted U-Boat warfare. In 1920 the League of Nations awarded Spitzbergen to Norway despite Russian claims to the islands. The transition from an agricultural country to a modern industrial state brought with it inflation and unemployment after the Great War, leading to a radicalization of the Worker's Party which had been founded in 1887. In 1923 a Communist Party was formed, and in 1933 appeared the fascist party Nosjonal Samling under leadership of Vidkun Quisling.;;;;;;;;;;X

NIC_DESC;The liberal President JosÈ Santos Zalaya (1894 - 1909), who had pursued a course of modernization of Nicaragua, was overthrown with the help of the U.S.A. who saw their interests in the Panama Canal endangered by Zalaya's expansionist politics.

NEP_DESC;After successful campaigning against Tibet in the late 18th century, the ruling Gurkhas in Nepal were shown their limits when their attacks on British India between 1814 and 1816 led to them having to recognize a factual British protectorate over their territory. A permanent Resident of the British Crown was sent to Nepal after the Peace of Segauli, and he remained there till 1923. In return, the British acknowledged the borders of Nepal and the rule of the Gurkhas. From 1850 on Nepal provided the British Colonial Army with the famous Gurkha regiments who were first employed during the Sepoy Uprising in 1857. Gurkhas also fought along British troops during World War I and the relationships between the two countries were tightened with a treaty of friendship in 1923. The domestic politics after 1775 were dominated by power struggles between the kings and the nobility. Three underage kings in a row (1775 till 1832) who were dominated by aristocratic families vying for power additionally weakened the Shah Dynasty. The most influential family were at first the Thapa (1806 - 1837) before the Rana family prevailed. 1846, after the king's nephew, Jang Bahadur Rana (1846 - 1877), had massacred the opposition on Kot Square, the Rana family took power for the following 104 years, making the office of Prime Minister hereditary, reducing the king's power to a minimum.;;;;;;;;;;X

MONROE_DESC;The Monroe Doctrine, expressed in 1823, proclaimed the Americas should be free from future European colonization and free from European interference in sovereign countries' affairs. It further stated United States's intention to stay neutral in European wars and wars between European powers and their colonies but to consider any new colonies or interference with independent countries in the Americas as hostile acts toward the United States. It was issued by President James Monroe during his seventh annual address to Congress.;;;;;;;;;;X
MON_DESC;Stuck between the gigantic empires of Russia and China, the land of Genghis Khan has long had to struggle for its independence. Though freed from Chinese rule following the collapse of the ruling Manchu dynasty in 1911, Mongolia's independence was not recognized by the new Republic of China, and therefore Mongolia increasingly turned to Russia for its continued survival. Yet, the unexpected Russian Revolution of 1917 placed Mongolia in a vulnerable position, with the Russian Civil War soon spilling over the border into its protectorate. After suffering from an invasion by a Chinese warlord army, a counter-invasion by White Russian forces under Baron Roman Nicolaus von Ungern-Sternberg, an uprising by the Mongolian Partisan Army of Sukhe Bator, and finally a coup that toppled the old Monarchy entirely, Mongolia emerged as the second Communist state in the world and the Soviet Union's only ally, though under tight Soviet control. Though finally stable by 1924, Mongolian history was henceforth to reflect all the tragedies that consumed their larger neighbor to the north. Purges were conducted throughout the 1920s to rid the country of 'capitalist' elements, Buddhist monks and religion were actively suppressed, and the power of the old feudal lords was destroyed. By 1936, however, the Socialist revolution is being tuned down in the face of a new threat from an expansionist Japan. The task now is to militarily prepare for the day, should it come, that Japan decides to add Mongolia to its growing empire.;;;;;;;;;;X

By the late 1930s, however, the Socialist revolution was being tuned down in the face of a new threat from an expansionist Japan. While defeated at Khalkhyn Gol, the Japanese remained defiant. Their newly launched campaign into the South Pacific leaves room for hope that Mongolia might remain neutral in the war raging around it, but the precarious state of the Soviet Union by late 1941 leaves little room for optimism. Should the Soviet Union fall, it's very likely Mongolia will fall as well without it's protector.;;;;;;;;;;X

By 1939, however, the Socialist revolution is being tuned down in the face of a new threat from an expansionist Japan. The start of fighting between the Japanese Kwangtung Army and the Soviets along the Khalkhyn Gol river in May has dragged Mongolia into the fighting on the side of the Soviets, but the battle now seems to be winding down to a decisive Soviet victory and Japan is retreating to lick its wounds. At present, the country appears to be safe.;;;;;;;;;;X

MEX_DESC;Wracked by years of revolution, rebellion, and repeated coups against corrupt governments, Mexico was finally on the path to recovery. Under the control of Plutarco ElÌas Calles in fact if not in name for the past decade, Mexico had gained a stable but corrupt government under the National Revolutionary Party, whose successive presidents were almost completely under Calles' thumb. By 1934, the increasingly conservative Calles was forced to make concessions to left-wing members of his party by agreeing to the nomination of L·zaro C·rdenas as the NPR's candidate for the presidency. It was to prove a fateful choice, C·rdenas was a scrupulously honest politician who refused to be controlled, and disputed with Calles on numerous issues. By the beginning of 1936, the political environment was growing increasingly volatile between the former strong man and this new rival for power. The only question was who would make the first move......;;;;;;;;;;X

MAN_DESC;The Manchu dynasty ruled China until the revolution in 1911 caused the abdication of the final Manchurian Emperor Hsuan T'ung. In 1931, Chinese Nationalists began to challenge the growing influence over Manchuria that the Japanese had been exerting.  In response the Kwangtung Army occupied Manchuria.  In 1932 Japan declared that the region would be an independent Manchu state named Manchukuo.  The final Manchu Dynasty emperor, now called K'ang Te, was installed as emperor of Manchukuo in 1934.  The Japanese military maintained tight control of Manchukuo and few foreigners were allowed into the nation, while the Japanese greatly expanded the region's industrial capacity;;;;;;;;;;X

LUX_DESC;The Vienna Congress of 1814-1815 proclaimed Luxemburg a Grand Duchy and made it part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The Dutch King, was, as Grand Duke of Luxemburg, at the same time member of the German League. After the Belgian independence in 1831 Netherlands had to grant its wallonic territories to Belgium by rule of the London Protocol of 1839. The Dutch attempts to sell the Grand Duchy to the French after the end of the German League in 1866 caused the Luxemburg Crisis which ended when the small country was formally granted its independence and neutrality. The personal union with the Netherlands ended in 1890 with the death of Wilhelm III, the last male heir of the house Orania-Nassau. The Salian law of Luxemburg did not allow for female heirs to the crown. During World War I Germany did not observe the neutrality of the country, occupying the Grand Duchy.;;;;;;;;;;X

LIT_DESC;As the power of Czarist Russia dwindled, Lithuania slowly made steps towards independence. In 1905/07 they received partial autonomy and called for a constitutional assembly. During World War I the country was occupied by the Germans, and, after successful Russian Revolution, declared independence in 1918 as a democratic republic. This caused the Red Army to march into Vilnius to bring the young state back into Russia, but the intervention of German and Polish troops preserved Lithuania's integrity. Poland nevertheless annexed Vilnius during the Russian-Polish War of 1920. This annexation was recognized by a referendum in 1922. In 1923 Lithuania annexed the Memel area which had till 1919 been under Prussian rule and had been under administration by the Allies since then. The conference of the Allies' ambassadors acknowledged the annexation but insisted of internal autonomy for the region. The time after The Great War was marked by internal crisis in Lithuania. The government decided on a land reform in 1922, taking land from the big landowners and robbing them also of their political and economical leadership. Social tension kept increasing and thus permitted the toppling of the government in 1926 by the army and the right-wing Tautinenkae party. The republican constitution was repealed and an authoritarian regime under Antanas Smetona was installed. In 1934, the Baltic Entente was formed with Latvia and Estonia.;;;;;;;;;;X

LIB_DESC;Created in the early 19th century by freed African-Americans who either wanted to return to Africa to start a new life or were forced to leave, Liberia was to eventually earn the honor, alongside Ethiopia, of being the only independent country in Africa. Since their declaration of independence from the Great Britain in 1846, Liberia has dealt peacefully with several border conflicts with both France and Britain over the years. The twentieth century has seen many years of tension for Liberia between the African-American colonists and the indigenous peoples of the area, with an international commission from the League of Nations investigating charges of slavery and forced labor in 1929. In the coming conflict Liberia will be an important part of the Allied war effort, as its rubber supply could be vital;;;;;;;;;;X

LDESC_TRANSPORT_PLANE;Transport Planes are designed to ferry men and materials over long distances to where they are needed quickly. Paratroopers rely on Transport Planes in order to reach their objective and stay supplied from the air.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_TRANSPORT;Naval Transports are important for moving supplies and resources around the world. They can also be used to ferry land units across stretches of water. They are completely unarmed however, and unless well protected will be vulnerable to attack by other naval units or aircraft.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_TORPEDO_PLANE;Carrier Air Groups are designed primarily to support warships in naval combat. They include carrier based fighters, torpedo planes and dive bombers, as well as specialized recon planes.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_TACTICAL_BOMBER;Tactical Bombers are a medium sized aircraft, larger than fighters, yet smaller than Strategic Bombers, which are used primarily for delivering attacks against enemy ground units such as Armour and Infantry.  Although they have a limited dog-fighting capability, they can be easily outmatched by fighters in air combat.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_SUBMARINE;The Submarine is designed to travel underwater allowing it to operate clandestinely against other naval units. Its main armament consists of torpedoes which can be deadly against all other types of vessel, be it Carrier, Battleship, Naval Transport or another Submarine. However, the Submarine can be handicapped by a short range and new technologies to improve them can be expensive.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_STRATEGIC_BOMBER;Strategic Bombers are the heaviest of the aircraft types and are designed to deliver a large payload of bombs to enemy provinces, with the aim of crippling his industry and infrastructure. However, the Strategic Bomber is slow despite its long range, which can leave it vulnerable to attack by fighters.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_PARATROOPER;Paratroopers are one of the elite branches of the Infantry, who are specifically trained to either para-drop to the ground or be ferried to a battleground in gliders. Their rapid deployment capability makes them ideal for use as a mobile reserve, or for use in capturing a strategic asset behind enemy lines. However, they are handicapped by a lack of heavy equipment due to their mode of travel, and when they are in action it is advisable to move other units to their support.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_PANZER;Armoured units allow real projection of power on the battlefield. Their speed and firepower make them lethal against all but the best entrenched Infantry. However, as tanks became heaver, their speeds would reduce accordingly.  They also required a constant supply of fuel to remain in the field, and if this vital supply was severed, the armored unit would be next to useless.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_NAVAL_BOMBER;The Naval Bomber is only marginally larger than a Fighter aircraft. It is designed to work in close cooperation with naval units and provide pinpoint tactical strikes against enemy surface vessels. They have a limited dog-fighting capability, which can leave them vulnerable if intercepted by fighters.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_MOTORIZED;Motorized Infantry make use of wheeled vehicles, such as trucks, to maneuver more rapidly than basic Infantry. But they are limited to the use of roads, and their performance may suffer in provinces with low infrastructure levels.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_MILITIA;Militia are a cheap and rapidly formed Infantry unit. Their hurried training and poor equipment mean they are of little use in combat, although they can be useful for controlling territory and as a last line of defense when no other units are available.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_MECHANIZED;Mechanized Infantry are equipped with all-terrain vehicles, such as the halftrack, which does not limit them to roads as with Motorized Infantry and allows them to work well with armored units. However, the specialist equipment they require, means their cost is high as a result.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_MARINE;Marines are one of the elite branches of the Infantry, who are specifically trained for assaulting beaches and other naval operations. They make use of specialized equipment and tactics to give them an edge over regular Infantry in such an environment.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_INFANTRY;Infantry will most likely make up the bulk of your armies. They are relatively cheap to build and require no regular fuel supply to maneuver, but their lack of motorized transportation means their speed of advance is limited. However, Infantry are able to occupy large areas of land, securing ground captured by other arms of your forces.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_FLYING_ROCKET;The Flying Rocket (the equivalent of the German V2) was designed to deliver a payload of explosives to a non-specific target. Its high speed made it practically impossible to intercept, but its low payload meant that it made more of a psychological impact than a destructive one.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_FLYING_BOMB;The Flying Bomb (the equivalent of the German V1) is basically an unmanned aircraft powered by an early rocket engine, designed to deliver a payload of explosives to a non-specific target. It is slower than the Flying Rocket, which means that in some cases it can be intercepted and shot down by enemy fighters.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_FIGHTER;Fighters are light aircraft designed primarily to combat other fighter aircraft and enemy bombers. They are smaller and more agile than bombers, which means that for bombers to stand any chance of survival against fighters, they must have their own escort of these type of craft.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_ENGINEER;Engineer Brigades will increase the ability of the unit they are attached to when crossing rivers, making the process quicker and reducing disorganization.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_DIVE_BOMBER;The Dive Bomber is only marginally larger than a Fighter aircraft. It is designed to work in close cooperation with ground units and provide pinpoint tactical strikes to aid in disorganizing enemy forces. They have a limited dog-fighting capability, which can leave them vulnerable if intercepted by fighters.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_DESTROYER;The Destroyer is the smallest and the fastest of the surface ships. It is lightly armed in comparison with the battleship, but its speed and maneuverability allows it to provide a good first line of defense away from the main capital ships of a fleet, and its light guns are useful for targeting threats from the air. Destroyers are usually combined in groups, and used for convoy escort and anti-submarine duties.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_CRUISER;The Cruiser is primarily used as a hunting ship, to search for, and destroy enemy shipping. They are smaller, and less heavily armed than Battleships, but they make up for these deficiencies in speed.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_CAVALRY;Cavalry are able to move fairly rapidly over most types of terrain, and do not require a supply of fuel to operate, but they are lightly armed when compared with Armored units, and the advanced weapons of the time can inflict devastating casualties to both men and horses. That is not to say that Cavalry can't prove useful in some instances as a mobile reserve.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_CARRIER;The Aircraft Carrier is rapidly becoming the most important naval vessel. Its ability to project power through the aircraft it carries makes it dangerous to other capital ships and land forces. However, the ship itself is only lightly armed, and must rely on other naval units, as well as its own aircraft, to afford it protection.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_BERGSJAEGER;Mountain Troops are one of the elite branches of the Infantry, who are specifically trained for operations in mountainous provinces.  They make use of specialized equipment and tactics to give them an edge over regular Infantry in such an environment.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_BATTLESHIP;The Battleship is the Queen of the Sea. It is a massive floating gun platform, designed primarily to engage enemy capital ships at long range and send them to the bottom of the ocean. However, they remain vulnerable to air or submarine torpedo attacks, and the advent of the Aircraft Carrier has started to number their days.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_ARTILLERY;Artillery pieces will increase the 'Soft Attack' attributes of your units, inflicting more damage on Infantry and Motorized units.;;;;;;;;;;X
LDESC_ANTITANK;Anti-Tank weapons will increase the 'Hard Attack' attributes of your units, inflicting more damage on Armored and Mechanized units.;;;;;;;;;;X

LAT_DESC;During World War I, German troops occupied Latvia, then part of Czarist Russia, and German plans of annexing the country led to anti-German sentiments. Nevertheless, when Latvian Bolsheviks attempted to re-integrate the state into the newly founded Soviet Union, German free corps helped defend the young country's independence in 1918. After the external threat was over, the eternal conflict between Latvians and Baltic Germans who made up a notable part of the upper class flared up again. Eventually, the Germans were dispossessed of their belongings in 1922, breaking the predominance of the old elites. After Hitler's rise to office in 1933 Latvia found herself between two expansionist powers. The Baltic Entente was formed in 1934, with Estonia and Lithuania. The former leader of the independence movement, Karlis Ulmanis, began turning Latvia into a dictatorship in 1936.;;;;;;;;;;X

JAP_DESC;The only non-western country to successfully negotiate the transition from a traditional economy and society to an advanced industrial nation-state, Japan did well out of the First World War, occupying the former German Pacific island chains and clearly advancing its claim to be the preeminent power in Asia. But financial misfortunes during the 1920s destabilized Japanís civilian parliamentary government, and led the way for a series of bloody coups and assassinations by extreme nationalist military leaders. An increasing concern at the countryís poor raw materials base, essential for the subjugation of further colonial territory, led the military to attack Manchuria in 1931 ñ part of Japanís long-standing aim of achieving hegemony over China. This brought material rewards but also loud complaints from the western democracies, which now seemed increasingly hostile towards Japanís strategic goals. Japan in 1936 stands at a crossroads with many options but no straightforward path. Should it press ahead with a full-scale assault on China, regardless of how vast a task that might be? Is an offensive against Soviet Siberia a better long-term plan? Or how about the oil and rubber-rich provinces of South East Asia? The Americans may prove dangerous foes, they too must be taken into account.;;;;;;;;;;X
JAP_41_DESC;Japan saw the outbreak of the European war as an opportunity in the Pacific. While British, French and Dutch attentions were occupied elsewhere, the Japanese might be able to harvest the rich resources of the colonial empires of South East Asia: badly needed resources like rubber and oil could be found in plenty in Malaya, Indo-China, and the East Indies. Only this way, thought the Japanese military elite now ruling the country, would Japan be able to finally end its sluggish battle of attrition in China and assert its predominance across the eastern world. However, the plan had one chief obstacle: the attitude of the United States. The Roosevelt administration was clearly not prepared to countenance any Japanese actions in SE Asia without a fight, as it proved in 1941 when America embargoed sales of oil in protest at Japan's takeover of Vichy French territory in Vietnam and Cambodia. Only by removing the American military threat, concluded the generals, could Japan be free to act. To this end Japan's most formidable strategic planner, Admiral Yamamoto, forged a scheme to attack the US Pacific Fleet at its Pearl Harbor base, and so damage American confidence that the country would be bound to sue for peace. This attack took place a few days ago, and all reports indicate its almost complete tactical success: but now, with Japanese troops poised to cross enemy borders across Asia, the question remains. Will Japan's great gamble against the overwhelming industrial power of America pay off?;;;;;;;;;;X

A further full-scale attack on China began in 1937, but despite many battlefield triumphs an end to the conflict still seems far off. As war breaks out in far-off Europe, Japan stands at a crossroads with many options but no straightforward path.

ITA_DESC;Italy entered the First World War with high expectations of gaining territory in the Alps and along the Adriatic shoreline from the Austro-Hungarians, and perhaps taking part in the carve-up of the moribund Ottoman Empire. Its actual performance in that war was disappointing, however, and it received less than expected from the Versailles settlement following the Armistice. This further weakened the countryís already unstable parliamentary democracy and paved the way for Benito Mussoliniís famous ëMarch on Romeí in 1922, which helped establish Europeís first fascist dictatorship. To help bolster the popularity of his autocratic regime Mussolini was pledged to return Italy to Great Power status, to build up formidable land, sea and air forces, and to expand the Italian colonial empire. In 1936 he is poised to conduct his first major step in this campaign, an offensive against the Abyssinians which will (he hopes) remove the ignominious stain of Italyís 1898 defeat at Adowa. But this attack is bound to be diplomatically controversial, and it is far from clear whether Italyís modest industrial resources are capable of extended war. The fate of the Italian fascist experiment is uncertain.;;;;;;;;;;X
ITA_41_DESC;Italy has not had a happy war. In June 1940, flushed with confidence after Germany's rapid success against France and Britain in the Ardennes offensive, Mussolini declared war on the West in the hopes of joining in the rich harvest. But despite France's surrender, Italian victories have been frustratingly few. In North and Eastern Africa a series of initial Italian assaults against British colonial territory were vigorously rebuffed, and Mussolini was forced to request German aid. The daring British attack on the fleet at Taranto set back Italy's hopes of challenging the Royal Navy's maritime supremacy in the Mediterranean. And an abortive attack on Greece was thwarted so effectively by the defenders that Germany had to bail out Italy in the Balkans. Now, with German attentions focused almost exclusively on the Eastern Front, Mussolini must decide how he can remove Italy from the shadow of its larger Axis partner and forge a truly independent military strategy. Italy does have some advantages: the British are weak in Africa and could easily be ejected from Egypt with some tactical skill. The difficulty will be acting before the United States can throw in its weight against Italy's small land, sea and air forces. And the conquered Greek and Yugoslavian provinces remain a hotbed of resistance, a constant security burden for the overstretched Italians.;;;;;;;;;;X
ITA_39_DESC;Italy entered the First World War with high expectations of gaining territory in the Alps and along the Adriatic shoreline from the Austro-Hungarians, and perhaps taking part in the carve-up of the moribund Ottoman Empire. Its actual performance in that war was disappointing, however, and it received less than expected from the Versailles settlement following the Armistice. This further weakened the country's already unstable parliamentary democracy and paved the way for Benito Mussolini's famous 'March on Rome' in 1922, which helped establish Europe's first fascist dictatorship. To help bolster the popularity of his autocratic regime Mussolini was pledged to return Italy to Great Power status, to build up formidable land, sea and air forces, and to expand the Italian colonial empire. In 1936 his successful offensive against the Abyssinians removed the ignominious stain of Italy's 1898 defeat at Adowa, but the attack permanently alienated Italy from the West. Now, as war clouds loom over Europe, should Italy throw its hat into the ring? The booty of conquest beckons, but it is far from clear whether Italy's modest industrial resources are capable of extended war. The fate of the Italian fascist experiment is uncertain.;;;;;;;;;;X

IRQ_DESC;Iraq is a new nation in the world community. Though it broke free from the Ottoman empire in the wake of that empire's collapse following the Great War, the League of Nations disregarded Britain's promised support of Arab independence and assigned large tracts of the Middle East to European mandates. The result was a costly uprising for the British, and a new plan for Britain's new mandate. The British imposed a monarchy, and prepared for the future independence of Iraq, to be ruled by the Hashemite family. However, the state lacked legitimacy. Not only was it imposed from outside of the country, it was clearly a British puppet regime which wrote it's constitution according to British 'advice' and drew it's territorial boundaries according to British wishes (and with little regard to tribal or ethnic frontiers). Nevertheless, it's willingness to cooperate with Britain meant that it was one of the first mandates to end, being granted full sovereignty in 1932 and joining the League of Nations in October of that same year, as well as being one of the founding members of the League of Arab States. By 1936, the regime still faces the problem of legitimacy and there is grumbling amongst the military, but how Iraq will fare in the years to come remains unknown.;;;;;;;;;;X

Yet, in 1936, the instability of the old regime led to a military coup d'Ètat led by General Bakr Sidqi, placing the military forever after on the Iraqi political scene. Sidqi's government was to be short-lived, due to his brutal excesses, and he was murdered by the military in August 1937. Iraq's stability problems were not over yet. An Anglophobic Arab nationalist by the name of Rashid Ali Al-Gaylani became prime minister in 1941, and promptly tried to curtail Britain's continued domination of the region by seeking aid from Germany. When ministers still loyal to the British pressed him to resign, yet another coup d'Ètat was organized, with Al-Gaylani supported by four pro-Axis generals known as the 'Golden Square.' It didn't take Britain long to react, and the short-lived Al-Gaylani regime was toppled within a month by the arrival of British troops, sending Al-Gaylani to exile in Germany. By the end of 1941, Iraq is firmly under British control.;;;;;;;;;;X

IRE_DESC;In mid-19th century the Green Isle was economically weak and easily troubled by crisis. Between 1846 and 1849 the potato harvest had been completely destroyed and a famine ravaged the land, leading to mass emigration of Irish to the U.S.A. Gradually, voices grew louder in Great Britain, calling for an independence of Ireland from the British Crown. The Liberal Prime Minister William E. Gladstone initiated the separation of the island from the Anglican church in 1869 and a land reform in 1870. He failed in his attempts of pushing through a Home Rule for Ireland, however. The political resistance in Ireland kept growing. The Home Rule League and the Irish Land League fought for autonomy as a first step towards independence. In 1914 self government was supposed to commence, but it was delayed with the outbreak of World War 1. The disappointment about this delay culminated - supported by German intelligence - in the suppression of the Easter Uprising. Continued unrests further delayed the way to independence. Ireland, excluding the northern region of Ulster, was awarded the status of Free State in 1921 but kept in bond to the British Crown. A bloody civil war between opponents and supporters of the compromise followed in 1922/23. Only Eamon de Valera managed to cut the last ties to Great Britain from 1932 on.;;;;;;;;;;X

HUN_DESC;Following closely after the armistice of November 1918, a democratic national council under Prime Minister Mih·ly Count K·rolyi declared Hungary an independent republic. The neighboring countries, especially Romania and the new Kingdom of Serbs, Slovenes, and Croats, seized the opportunity for territorial conquests. Domestic disputes about the future design of the republic forced the K·rolyi government to resign, and the Socialist Party of Hungary, a coalition of Communists and Social Democrats, took power. Under the leadership of BÈla Kun a council republic was established. Their attempts at forced social reforms soon led to violent conflicts, however. With the aid of Czech and Romanian troops the forces of restoration managed to crush the republic within a matter of months, at first leading to 'white terror', costing the lives of many supporters of the political left. The situation remained unclear. After the 1920 elections a constitution containing both autocratic and parliamentary elements was ratified. The question of whether or not the last Habsburg, Karl IV, was to become King of Hungary was solved with a compromise. An administrator was appointed instead of a monarch, with former navy admiral MiklÛs Horthy heeding the call. In the peace treaty of Trianon 1920 Hungary formally acknowledged many territorial claims: the Czechoslovakian for Slovakia, the Romanian for Siebenb¸rgen, and the Yugoslavian for Croatia and Slovenia. Hungary had lost 70 percent of her territory and 65 percent of her population. Two coup attempts in 1921 to bring Karl IV onto the throne failed while Horthy exploited his position to take power from the parliament and persecute democratic forces. Horthy reacted to the Great Depression and the social tensions accompanying it by appointing the ultra conservative Gyula Hˆmbˆs as prime minister (1932 - 1936) who would conduct the conducted Hungary's rapprochement towards Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy.;;;;;;;;;;X

Only after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1939 did Hungary achieve minor expansion. In 1940 Hungary joined the Three Powers Pact and in 1941 HonvÈd troops participated in the attack on Yugoslavia and later in the assault on the Soviet Union. The country was by then a German puppet, tied into Hitler's war production and effort.;;;;;;;;;;X

HON_DESC;Though once a border territory of the Mayan Empire, Honduras became a colony of Spain by the 1700s, with Britain controlling the Eastern coast (which was seized in order to combat Caribbean piracy). With independence from Spain in 1821 Honduras, like the other nations of Central America, slid into a period of continued unrest. Since the early 1900s, however, foreign fruit companies, particularly the rivals United Fruit and Standard Fruit, have dominated Honduran politics. Their grip over the banana trade, which made up for over two-thirds of Honduran exports, led to the phrase 'Banana Republic' being coined in reference to Honduras. The fall of banana prices during the Great Depression would lead to a period of instability culminating in an insurrection by liberals in protest of the (surprisingly fair) election of the pro-military Tiburcio CarÌas Andino. The resulting crackdown would soon put an end not only to those who had risen against CarÌas, but also to any form of political dissent. Honduras, like so many other Latin American countries of the period, was now in the hands of a rabidly anti-communist, pseudo-fascist dictator.;;;;;;;;;;X

HOL_DESC;While preserving European neutrality (the struggle against Belgium was declared an internal conflict) the Netherlands faced all the fiercer challenges in their colonies. In 1830 an uprising in Java had to be subdued by force. A war against the Sultanate Ateh, joined by various local princes, erupted on Sumatra in 1873 and could only be ended in 1904. The Cape Province, Ceylon, and the Gold Coast had been lost to Great Britain. In domestic policies an agreement was reached between the crown and the growing liberal movement in 1848. Wilhelm II, under influence by Liberal leader Jan Rudolf Thorbecke, installed a liberal constitution which transformed the country into a parliamentary monarchy. Thorbecke became the first prime minister and fortified the - by the time's standards - modern system of government. Internally, the Netherlands stabilized herself permanently, with only the census based suffrage being a major point of conflict till universal and equal suffrage was introduced in 1917. In 1894 a Social Democratic Party formed which, unlike her European cousins of the time, aimed at reforms and not revolutions. Their strict neutrality qualified the Netherlands as host for the great congresses of 1899 and 1905, during which, among other things, the Den Haag Convention with Respect to the Laws and Customs of War on Land was agreed upon. After the country had preserved its neutrality during World War I, it was decided upon to install the International Court in Den Haag.;;;;;;;;;;X

HAI_DESC;The nation of Haiti takes its name from the word used by the local Arawak Indians for the island of Hispanola, which they called 'Hayti', or mountainous land. Owned by the French since the 17th century, Haiti became a particularly rich colony noted for its particularly large proportion of slaves to free Frenchmen. In 1791 Haitians launched a successful slave revolt, and by 1804 were the first independent black nation in the New World. Though there quickly arose a class system with a minority of light-skinned, Catholic, French-speaking Haitians ruling over a dark-skinned, voodoo worshiping, Creole-speaking majority, Haiti soon devolved into chaos after its independence. Haiti's first ruler, the 'Emperor' General Dessalines, was assassinated following his rampant abuse of power. In 1844 Haiti split in two, with the Dominican Republic declaring independence from Haiti. Continuing unrest led to the United States sending in the Marines in 1915, who would occupy the country (and give still more power to the lighter skinned Haitians) until their departure in 1934. Upon the Marine's departure there were many more hospitals and schools but the country still dangerously disunited. A vicious power struggle would soon ensue between Catholic Haitians and those Haitians who follow voodoo. Currently the Catholic mulattos have the upper hand, with a mulatto President, Stenio Vincent, who has ruled since the United States' occupation.;;;;;;;;;;X

GUA_DESC;After the liberal revolution of 1871 Justo Rufino Barrios (1873 - 1885) reformed the country politically and economically. The privileges of the catholic church were largely removed. The Jesuits were expelled, monasteries were secularized, and schools came under state control. State and church were separated, and free choice of religion was introduced as well as direct elections. The infrastructure was expanded, bringing economic progress. The export of Cochenille became obsolete with the development of chemical dyes, and so the economy shifted towards coffee and bananas. Soon the coffee trade was under German control, and the banana production under U.S. control. The Indians remained without rights. The properties of the indigenous people were dispossessed to expand the areas for the growth of coffee and bananas. Under General Manuel Estrada Carrera (1899 - 1920), who brought the country closer to the U.S.A., the influence of the United Fruit Company grew. The U.S. companies increasingly meddled with the domestic politics of Guatemala. Conservatives, military, and workers' movement (Movimiento Unionista) opposed this American influence and in 1920 overthrew the Carrera government. Henceforth, the military had great influence on the various short-lived governments who were not able to restrict the influence of United Fruit. Relative stability was only reached under the last of the Caudillos (leader) Jorge Ubico Castaneda who came to power in 1931 and established a repressive regime during the Great Depression. Elections were abolished and opposition parties and unions were banned. Castaneda tried to strengthen the crippled economy by increasing banana and coffee exports.;;;;;;;;;;X

GRE_DESC;Greece's independence from Ottoman rule was officially declared in 1829/30, with the Peace of Adrianople, ending the 6th Russian-Turkish War, and the London Protocol. However, the country was not stabilized until the Danish Prince Wilhelm climbed the Greek throne as Georg I in 1863. Under his rule the country became a parliamentary monarchy with limited powers for the monarch. Also, Thessaly and parts of Epirus were brought under Greek rule in 1881. Despite a defeat against the Ottomans in 1897 when Greece supported the Cretan uprising the island could - by pressure of the major powers - join the state territory. Macedonia was conquered in the Second Balkans War (1912/13) from Bulgaria, leading to continuously bad relations between the two countries. During World War One King Konstantin I saw to it that his country remained neutral at first, but pressure from the Entente and Prime Minister Eleutherios Venizelos forced him to abdicate in 1917, and Greece joined the war against the Middle Powers. With the occupation of Smyrna in 1919, Greece provoked a war against Turkey. A crushing defeat in 1922 was the result, and over a million Greeks fled from Asia Minor to the Hellenistic mainland. This intake of people facilitated a land reform that would end the dominance of big landowners. The supporters of Venizelos urged to turn the state into a republic, and indeed succeeded with their effort between 1924 and 1935. In 1935 the royalists prevailed one more time, bringing Georg II back onto the throne. The fascist regime of Ioannis Mataxas from 1936 on would leave the king mostly powerless, though.;;;;;;;;;;X

GER_DESC;Germanyís defeat in 1918, ushered in its first democratic government, as well as a legacy of economic misery and irredentist resentment against the ëslave treatyí of Versailles. Shorn of its colonies and its Polish provinces, burdened with reparations payments and an artificially weakened army, treated as a pariah state for its alleged responsibility for the war, Germanyís political path throughout the Weimar Republican years was a tragic spiral of violence and extremism. The ascent of Adolf Hitlerís National Socialist Party in 1933 marked a turning point in Germanyís historical development. Representative government, comprehensive civil rights and a free press were quickly swept away by the incoming Nazis, who embarked on an increasingly vicious campaign of repression against the nationís ëundesirablesí, Jews, Communists, Trade Unionists, and other opponents of the regime. But Hitler also revitalized Germanyís languishing economy and promised to end the inequities of Versailles. By 1936, Germans wonder what their F¸hrerís first major step will be on the international stage. The remilitarization of the Rhineland? The long-awaited Anschluss with Austria? A showdown with Czechoslovakia or Poland over their disputed German-majority provinces? Only the enigmatic ruler in Berlin knows for sure.;;;;;;;;;;X
GER_41_DESC;Germany's rapid victory over Poland in September 1939, with the assistance of its temporary Soviet ally, proved the worth of the new 'lightning' armored warfare tactics advanced by innovative military thinkers like Heinz Guderian. During the temporary lull in the fighting, the German High Command adopted an ambitious plan of conquest against France and the Low Countries: instead of beating their heads uselessly against the formidable Maginot defenses or trying a re-run of the 1914 Schlieffen Plan, German forces would break through the weak French positions along the Ardennes forest and attempt a massive encirclement of the northern Anglo-French line. In May 1940 this plan, masterminded by General von Manstein, succeeded beyond anyone's wildest expectations: France surrendered after only six weeks' fighting and the British were forced to evacuate their troops at Dunkirk. This left Germany master of Europe but also left a grand strategic dilemma. The UK was subdued but undefeated, and after the failure of the Luftwaffe in the Battle of Britain no realistic seaborne invasion could be attempted for some time. Instead, Hitler turned his attention eastwards to the USSR, the natural target for his dreams of pan-European 'Lebensraum'. In June 1941, Operation Barbarossa unleashed a whirlwind of destruction against Stalin's dilapidated army, and as winter arrives the Germans now stand at the gates of Moscow. But can they maintain the offensive in the dreadful Russian weather conditions? And will the USA's entry into the war permanently alter the balance of power in the West before the Germans can return victorious from their Soviet conquests?;;;;;;;;;;X

Can the still-modest German war machine defeat such a formidable array of enemies? Only the enigmatic ruler in Berlin knows for sure.;;;;;;;;;;X

FRA_DESC;Franceís manpower losses in the First World War were proportionally larger than those of any other major belligerent, and this demographic catastrophe was reflected in the shortfall of annual army conscripts, the so-called ëhollow classesí - of the interwar period. With a revived Germany, a self-aggrandizing Italy, and an increasingly unstable Spain on its borders, France could not afford to accept this military weakness without abandoning its pretensions to Great Power status. To compensate, the nation threw itself into a massive fortified works project on the Franco-German frontier during the early 1930s, and tried to build new diplomatic arrangements with the ëlittle ententeí powers of central and eastern Europe. By 1936, this has had mixed results. Franceís immediate security problems have been partially resolved by its mighty Maginot Line (but what of the unprotected Belgian border?), and it has warm relations with the Czechs and Poles - and even a developing rapprochement with the Soviet Union. But the Third Republic is a deeply divided nation, with a brittle and unsteady political system, and whether it can still weather a serious challenge for the hegemony of the continent remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;X

FIN_DESC;With the demise of the Russian Czar's powers Finland, having been under her eastern neighbor's rule since 1808, was granted more autonomy. In 1906, a unicameral parliament was installed along with universal suffrage for men and women alike. The parliament, the first in Europe to have a Social Democratic majority since 1916, exploited Russia's weakness after the February Revolution of 1917 and declared Finland's independence in July 1917. The declaration of the right of self-determination proclaimed by the new Soviet government during the October Revolution strengthened the Finnish claim for independence. On 6th December 1917, the proclamation of sovereignty was repeated and acknowledged by the Soviet rulers in late December. An attempt of Finnish Socialists to seize power in early 1918, caused a bloody civil war in which the White Guards, supported by the German Kaiser, prevailed over the Socialist's Red Guards. After the defeat, the Communist Party separated from the Social Democrats and was declared illegal in 1930, after numerous attempts of insurgence. In 1921, Finland reached its largest expansion when the League of Nations declared the Aland Islands, Finnish territory. In 1932, the country signed a non-aggression pact with the USSR.;;;;;;;;;;X

In March 1940, however, Finland agreed to peace talks to avoid engagements of British and French against the Soviets on her soil. The Soviets received parts of Karelia and Eastern Finland, the shores of Lake Ladoga and Hanko. In Fall of 1940, German troops landed in Finland and in 1941, the country joined Nazi Germany in their war against the USSR, hoping to claim back their lost territories.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_4101_DESC;On 12th December 1936, Chiang Kai-shek was kidnapped by his mutinous army in Manchuria. Chiang was captured by Generals Chang Hsueh-liang and Yang Hu-cheng, who demanded an end to fighting between Chinese Nationalists (Guomindang) and communists in the face of the Japanese invasion. Chiang was released when the communists announced that they would cooperate with the Guomindang in opposing Japan. For the time being Chiang accepted this fragile truce and unholy alliance but later on with the fall of the Japanese he attacked the communists in full force.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_4100_NAME;The Nanking Massacre;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_4100_DESC;In the autumn of 1937, Japanese war planes began bombing Nanking, concentrating their efforts on the downtown areas, which were most densely populated by civilians. As Nanking came under attack, the capital was again moved, this time to Chungking. Knowing that Japanese troops were en route toward the city, the people panicked and tried to flee. On 9th December 1937, Japanese ground forces reached Nanking, where they were met with minimal resistance from overwhelmed and fatigued Chinese military units. By 13th December 1937, with Japanese troops attacking the city from all angles, the Chinese forces were routed. Fearing the consequences of surrender to the Japanese, Chinese military men donned civilian clothing and retreated into the city. It was on this day that the six-week stretch of atrocities against the civilian population of Nanking began. The news of the massacre soon hit the world and significantly deteriorated Japanís relations with the Democratic countries of the world.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_3900_DESC;After the German occupation of Denmark in April 1940, British forces swiftly took possession of Iceland to counter a possible threat of a German Invasion. Britain held it with few forces and in early 1941 it was evident that it would be better if the United States took over the watch-keeping. By the summer of 1941, U.S. troops occupied both Greenland and Iceland in the North Atlantic. The U.S. occupation of Greenland was arranged through an agreement between the United States government and a rebellious Danish Ambassador in Washington. This Danish Ambassador refused to recognize or obey the Danish government in Copenhagen after the German occupation of Denmark, which began in April 1940. The Greenland Agreement, signed in April 1941, encountered vigorous protests from both the Danish government and the German Embassy in Washington.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_3801_NAME;The USA Assassinates Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_3801_DESC;Admiral Yamamoto commanded the Combined Fleet before the outbreak of the Pacific War and during its first sixteen months. He was responsible for planning the attack on Pearl Harbor and most other major operations during this time. His scheme for eliminating the U.S. fleet as a major opponent led to the June 1942 Battle of Midway in which the Japan lost naval superiority in the Pacific. Despite Midway's adverse outcome, Yamamoto continued as Combined Fleet commander through the following Guadalcanal Campaign, which further depleted Japan's naval resources. One of the great advantages that the United States enjoyed in its war with Japan was the cracking of the Japanese code. This gave the U.S. advanced warning of impending Japanese operations. One such operation was a visit by Admiral Yamamoto to the Japanese base on Bougainvillea. Allied intelligence intercepted and decoded a message describing the visit, and the 13th Air Force decided to welcome him. Even the highest ranking American military commanders felt that to give a direct order to assassinate an enemy commander was above them, and the authorization for the mission eventually came all the way down from the office of the American presidency. On 18th April 1943, one year to the day after the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo, 18 American P-38s from the 13th Air Force launched from Guadalcanal, flew to Bougainvillea, found the Admiral's flight, and shot down his plane killing him.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_3800_NAME;US Oil Embargo;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_3800_DESC;In July 1941, the U.S. threatened Japan with an oil embargo unless Japan withdrew from China. Rather than withdraw from China and abandon its imperialist aspirations, Japan chose to attack the U.S. while it still had the oil reserves needed to wage war. Although the U.S. was also pursuing various deterrence strategies against Japan, the threat of an oil embargo was a more ambitious strategy of coercive diplomacy. The threat of embargo was intended not to deter Japan from taking some considered action, but to compel them to withdraw from a current activity. There were a number of reasons why coercive diplomacy not only failed, but actually provoked war in this case. First, U.S. officials failed to recognize that Japan had more at stake in the matter than did the U.S. As the situation progressed, the U.S. sharpened its demands, which in turn sharpened Japan's resistance. Second, the U.S. strategy relied almost entirely on threats, and made very little use of incentives. This left Japan to choose among almost equally unacceptable options. Finally, misperceptions, miscalculations and ambiguous signals between the U.S. and Japan contributed to the escalation of the conflict.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_3718_DESC;In an effort to meet the Fascist threat the United States mobilized much of its manpower and industry. However, as the Allies failed to win on the battlefield losses in lives grew. Further the United States had to shoulder the ever increasing burden of feeding and equipping her so called allies, inefficient and incompetent as they were. To pursue the war as efficiently as possible the US administration issued the US Rationing Act, the US Maximum Wage Act and the US Workforce Registration Act. US workers now had as much freedom in the labor market as their German counterparts. Slowly the tension increased as Labor Unions started to crave their 'human rights'. At first the administration let them be but as major strikes set in police were ordered onto the streets to force labor back to work. Several unionist leaders were tried and executed for treason. On 1st May the Major Trade Unions and the small Socialist and Communist parties peacefully marched to Washington from a number of East Coast cities. In the city riots started and a major fight between protesters and police forced the government to use the closest Infantry Division to restore order. However the young soldiers refused to fire at the mob and leaders of the leftist parties managed to organize the protesters into bands disarming the soldiers and themselves taking up arms against what they took as a government of crooks and thieves. When the capital was secured the leftist parties quickly got control of the chain of command of the administration and organized a new force of Armed Worker's Brigades. Incessant fighting started with local patriots, but in the end the new leftist government prevailed.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_3717_DESC;The dominant issue was the failing US economy. The President had abandoned parts of the New Deal programs, and the US economy was in a recession. Smith started out attacking the administration for abandoning the New Deal and reinventing the catastrophes of the Hoover administration. President Landon started out ignoring his opponents but as the campaign went on and Smith was surging in the polls Landon became more active and suggested that the elderly Smith suffered from a heart condition and was unsuited to be elected as President. This started a major medical debate where certain senators implied that Landon must have been lying to the public as several independent medical examinations showed that Smith had no health problems. Landon never managed to free himself of the accusations of having lied even if he made a national address repeating and explaining that he had never said that he knew anything of Smith's health specifically.

EVT_3716_DESC;Amid World War II Smith declined to attack the administration's foreign policy. Instead, he campaigned against the administration's economic policy which he said had brought recession and mass unemployment. The Republican President, who was pressed by the unemployment figures promised to resurrect certain New Deal programs, such as Social Security, but lambasted the Democratic Party for being what he called a wasteful and immature party. Smith immediately pointed out that it was all well that the current administration wanted to issue his policies, but that he recommended the voter's to vote for a real Democrat rather than a Republican with Democratic policies. The President though managed to get through his message that the election was about maturity and responsibility and that he both cut unemployment and balanced the budget, something his opponent would not be able to do.

Dewey promised to build on some New Deal programs, such as Social Security, but lambasted the administration for being what he called the most wasteful and incompetent administration in the nation's history. The Democrats pointed out that Dewey lacked foreign policy experience and that it was bad to change horses in midstream. The last point got through.

Wilkie stumped 30,000 miles, delivered more than 500 speeches in 34 states but failed to offer voters sufficient reason for ousting the incumbent. Roosevelt, confident of victory, remained in Washington ignoring his opponents until the last weeks.

Britain held it with few forces and in early 1941 it was evident that it would be better if the United States took over the watch-keeping. By the summer of 1941, U.S. troops occupied both Greenland and Iceland in the North Atlantic. The U.S. occupation of Greenland was arranged through an agreement between the United States government and a rebellious Danish Ambassador in Washington. This Danish Ambassador refused to recognize or obey the Danish government in Copenhagen after the German occupation of Denmark, which began in April 1940. The Greenland Agreement, signed in April 1941, encountered vigorous protests from both the Danish government and the German Embassy in Washington.;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_3704_NAME;Assassination of Yamamoto;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_3704_DESC;Admiral Yamamoto commanded the Combined Fleet before the outbreak of the Pacific War and during its first sixteen months. He was responsible for planning the attack on Pearl Harbor and most other major operations during this time. His scheme for eliminating the U.S. fleet as a major opponent led to the June 1942 Battle of Midway in which the Japan lost naval superiority in the Pacific. Despite Midway's adverse outcome, Yamamoto continued as Combined Fleet commander through the following Guadalcanal Campaign, which further depleted Japan's naval resources. One of the great advantages that the United States enjoyed in its war with Japan was the cracking of the Japanese code. This gave the U.S. advanced warning of impending Japanese operations. One such operation was a visit by Admiral Yamamoto to the Japanese base on Bougainvillea. Allied intelligence intercepted and decoded a message describing the visit, and the 13th Air Force decided to welcome him. Even the highest ranking American military commanders felt that to give a direct order to assassinate an enemy commander was above them, and the authorization for the mission eventually came all the way down from the office of the American presidency. On 18th April 1943, one year to the day after the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo, 18 American P-38s from the 13th Air Force launched from Guadalcanal, flew to Bougainvillea, found the Admiral's flight, and shot down his plane killing him.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_3701_NAME;Oil Embargo against Japan;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_3701_DESC;In July 1941, the U.S. threatened Japan with an oil embargo unless Japan withdrew from China. Rather than withdraw from China and abandon its imperialist aspirations, Japan chose to attack the U.S. while it still had the oil reserves needed to wage war. Although the U.S. was also pursuing various deterrence strategies against Japan, the threat of an oil embargo was a more ambitious strategy of coercive diplomacy. The threat of embargo was intended not to deter Japan from taking some considered action, but to compel them to withdraw from a current activity. There were a number of reasons why coercive diplomacy not only failed, but actually provoked war in this case. First, U.S. officials failed to recognize that Japan had more at stake in the matter than did the U.S. As the situation progressed, the U.S. sharpened its demands, which in turn sharpened Japan's resistance. Second, the U.S. strategy relied almost entirely on threats, and made very little use of incentives. This left Japan to choose among almost equally unacceptable options. Finally, misperceptions, miscalculations and ambiguous signals between the U.S. and Japan contributed to the escalation of the conflict.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_3406_NAME;The Independence of India;;;;;;;;;;X
EVT_3406_DESC;In November 1945, a British move to put the soldiers of the INA on trial sparked off a massive demonstration. Even more significant was the probable link between the INA and the wave of dissatisfaction in the British Indian Army during 1945-46 which resulted in the great Bombay Naval strike. Thus between 1942 and 1946, the foundation of British power in India was badly shaken. The Quit India movement had manifested the strong anti-British feeling of the Indian people. The Indian Army, Navy and the Air Force were the three strong pillars on which the British rule in India had rested for years. Even these forces were now displaying an anti-British sentiment. All these events convinced the British Rulers that they would not be able to hold India for long. The end of British imperialism was now clearly in sight. Although England emerged victorious in World War II, it no longer remained a powerful nation and lost its absolute power in the world. In a general election held in England, Churchill was replaced by Clement Atlee. Prime minister Atlee announced his intention to grant independence to India.

Some spoke, in fact, of une Europe allemande, a Europe dominated by Germany. PÈtain and his ministers thought that France, as a colonial power and a major influence on Europe between the wars, would be well placed to become an important ally to this powerful nation in the heart of a new European order, un nouveau ordre europÈen. A strong government - L'…tat franÁais, the French State, was created on 12th July 1940 - and some form of cooperation with Germany would be a necessary precondition for this.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_1140R_DESC;After the failed Coup d'Etat last week the country has been plunged into an information blackout. For more than three days all government sources denied that an attempted Coup had occurred. Now we know more. It seems an anti-patriotic clique had a deranged plan to murder the top figures of our government. Thankfully they failed and the survivors were brought to a Military Court last night. All involved confessed to this foul act and were hanged before the morning light broke.;;;;;;;;;;X

ETH_DESC;In 17th century the royal central power lost more and more of its influence so that Ethiopia broke into separate provinces in 18th century. Only in 1853 could Ras Kasa restore the country's unity with a strong central government again and climbed the throne in 1855 as Theodor II (till 1868). However, his attempt to reform state and church after the pattern of European countries failed. After 1885 Ethiopia was endangered by the Mahdi Uprising against the British-Egyptian rule in Sudan, but the Mahdi warriors were repelled. New danger arose around 1895 through Italy and her attempts to build a colonial empire on the Horn of Africa. With the victory of Emperor Menelik II over an Italian expeditionary corps near Adua in 1896 Ethiopia was the only African country besides Liberia to keep its independence during the Age of Imperialism. Domestically, Menelik II attempted a reform of the state administration and founded the new capital of Addis Abeba. With the aid of Great Britain Ras Tafari Makonnen took the rule in 1916 and was proclaimed king in 1928. After the death of Empress Zauditu in 1930 he was crowned Emperor Haile Selassie I. In the following years he attempted to turn Ethiopia, since 1930 member of the Peoples' League, into a modern country. In 1935 Fascist Italy renewed her attempts of turning Ethiopia into her colony and invaded the country;;;;;;;;;;X

EST_DESC;Occupied by German troops during World War I, the Russian February Revolution 1917 released powers vying for independence in Estonia. A national council was established, declaring - with German support - independence in 1918. The upper class, friendly towards the Germans, at first attempted to make the country part of Germany, but they were overruled in favor of the republic in 1919. The Soviet Union recognized the young state officially in 1920. The big landowners, sympathetic as they were towards Germany, were dispossessed. The republic's stability was proved during the Bolshevik attempt at a coup d'Ètat in 1924. With the beginning of the Great Depression in 1929 the harmonious development was disrupted by the rise of the fascist 'Front Fighters League'. Prime Minister Konstantin P‰ts, in power a number of times, reacted to the threat from the political right with the initiation of a dictatorial rule in 1934. In the same year, the Baltic Entente was formed with Latvia and Lithuania.;;;;;;;;;;X

ENG_DESC;The British Empire emerged from the 1914-1918 Great War larger than ever before, but the comfortable political and economic assurances of the Victorian era were gone for good. While Britainís relative industrial strength continued its slow decline, the Empireís security was threatened both internally by indigenous nationalist pressures, and externally by the resurgence of militant dictatorial powers like Italy, Germany, and Japan. At the same time, the Treasuryís demands for austerity in the midst of worldwide economic turmoil meant cutting defense expenditure to the bone, with the overstretched imperial armed services consequently unable to provide satisfactory coverage east as well as west of Suez. Diplomatically, the UK had staked much on the arbitration powers of the League of Nations, but the Leagueís ineffectiveness in Manchuria in 1931, augured ill for its future authority. While still committed to its alliance with France and sensitive to the traditional balancing of power in continental Europe, Britain in 1936 is a nation with many roles but a dwindling resource base with which to accomplish them.;;;;;;;;;;X
ENG_41_DESC;When the British Empire declared war on Germany in September 1939, its people expected the general course of events to go the same way as the Great War twenty years earlier. A small expeditionary force was sent to France, the Royal Navy took up its blockading position to thwart Germany's sea lines of communication, and the country awaited the inevitable German assault against the West. Initially, nothing happened. Indeed, for over six months scarcely any fighting took place between the combatant powers, and Britain settled into the welcome leisure of the 'Twilight War'. Then, in May 1940, Germany's surprise Blitzkrieg offensive against France and the Low Countries shattered this unnatural calm for good. British forces were rudely ejected from the European mainland, France fell, and the United Kingdom suddenly found itself alone and facing the possibility of imminent invasion. However, a heroic air defense that summer forestalled Hitler's 'Operation Sealion' attack, and by the spring of 1941, German attentions had switched east. The end of 1941 finds Britain in a difficult situation. The entry of the Soviet Union and the United States into the war has provided desperately needed allies in the struggle against Germany. However, British forces are in peril in North Africa and South East Asia, the U-Boat packs are threatening the UK's vital supply links, and a 'Second Front' in Europe seems years away. Will combined American, British and Soviet power be enough to push back the Axis?;;;;;;;;;;X

ECU_DESC;Ecuador suffered a bumpy development after her independence in 1809. Border uncertainties led to conflicts with Peru and Colombia while the rivaling oligarchies of the conservative big landowners in the highlands and the liberal populace on the coast fought each other bitterly. A first era of relative peace was achieved under the dictatorship of the church friendly conservative President Gabriel Garcia Moreno who expanded central administration, the educational system, and the infrastructure. In 1875 Moreno was assassinated, which brought about a time of domestic turmoil once more till the liberals under General Eloy Alfaro prevailed. He forced the expansion of the traffic network and restricted church influence. The good economic development, focusing on the increased growing of cocoa and coffee ended with the Great Depression 1929/30, destabilizing Ecuador's domestic situation again. A border conflict with Colombia was settled in 1931.;;;;;;;;;;X

If a Communist, he views Democrats as evil capitalists and Fascists as evil pseudo-capitalists. When it comes to ideology it is impossible to argue with him since he has already found his salvation.;;;;;;;;;;X

DPERSONALITY_AIR_TO_SEA_PROPONENT;This man is not only an able administrator and politician, but he also is meddling in the area of Grand Strategy.

DOM_DESC;In 1844 the Eastern part of the island of Hispaniola, since 1822 a part of the young country Haiti, declared its independence as Dominican Republic. Instability and foreign threats marked the early years of the new state. Restorative tendencies found the support of the oligarchy who, in the face of a border dispute with Haiti, put the country back under Spanish colonial rule in 1861 until revolts forced independence again in 1865. Economically and politically the Dominican Republic became more and more dependant on the U.S.A. who first openly intervened in 1905 to collect debts. Between 1916 and 1924 they occupied the country in order to get control over the financial and military institutions, beginning a democratization of the state. The military coup of General Rafael LÈonidas Trujillo y Molina in 1930 abolished the 1924 constitution again. He used a forceful way to modernize and centralize the country, not looking at the social havoc this caused.;;;;;;;;;;X

DEN_DESC;The Danish defeat in the 2nd German-Danish War of 1864 after which Denmark had to cede Schleswig-Holstein and Oldenburg to Prussia and Austria led to the country's withdrawal into neutrality and to a pressure for reforms within. Denmark had been a constitutional monarchy since 1849. Liberals and Social Democrats begun strengthening the parliament starting 1901. Economically, Denmark focused on expanding its agriculture which became the most important part of their exports. During World War I (1914 - 1918) the country remained neutral and continued the democratization process, introducing a democratic constitution in 1915. The primarily Social Democratic governments after The Great War laid the foundations for a welfare state that was patterned after the example of Sweden and even today secures the population one of the highest standards of living in the world. The foreign politics of Denmark marked several successes. In 1920 Northern Slesvig was re-integrated into the country after a referendum had been held by rule of the Versailles Peace Treaty. In 1933, the International Court in Den Haag decided a case between Norway and Denmark over the ownership of Greenland in favor of the Danish. However, the Germans had keen eyes on the country as it is strategically important in both controlling access to the Baltic Sea and the shipping of ore from Scandinavia.;;;;;;;;;;X

CZE_DESC;After the outbreak of World War One Czech philosopher Thom·s Garrigue Masaryk (1850 - 1937) and his close confidant Eduard Benes (1884 - 1948) worked for an independent state. With representatives of Slovakian immigrants in the U.S. they signed the Pittsburgh Treaty in May 1918, agreeing on the union of Czechs and Slovaks in a state to be founded. 1918, shortly before the military defeat of Austria-Hungary and Germany, independent Czechoslovakia was proclaimed in Prague. Masaryk was elected first president (1918 - 1935). However, the young country suffered from two shortcomings. For one, the relationship between Czechs and Slovaks who had lived for centuries under Hungarian rule proved to be difficult. The Slovak part of the country was mainly agriculturally oriented, and its citizens felt at a disadvantage against their Czech countrymen. For another, over three million Germans (Sudetendeutsche) lived in the new republic and only reluctantly acknowledged the Czech dominated state power. The government in Prague, however, despite proclaiming other intent, lacked tact and will of integration in their policies towards the minority. Despite those difficulties a working parliamentary system formed after 1920 with a broad array of political parties. Since 1926 members of the most important minorities (Germans, Hungarians) had representatives in the government. However, export-oriented as the areas with Sudeten Germans were, those regions were hardest hit by the Great Depression 1929/30 and more national tensions were the consequence. After Hitler's rise to power in Germany in 1933 the Sudeten German party SdP became more and more an instrument of Nazi expansionism and it would only be a matter of time till Adolf Hitler would face the young Czechoslovakian republic with territorial claims.;;;;;;;;;;X

CUB_DESC;The explosion of the U.S. warship Maine in the port of Havana in 1898 gave the U.S.A. the opportunity to declare war on Spain, colonial masters of the Caribbean island. In the Peace of Paris 1898 Spain had to cede Cuba, along with the Philippines and Puerto Rico to the United States who in turn put the island under military administration. Formally, independence was declared in 1900, but the Platt-Amendment of 1901 restricted the autonomy again, giving the U.S. the naval bases of Bahia Honda and Guantanamo in addition to the right to intervene in the case of internal unrest. In 1902 the United States withdrew from the island, leaving the government of the first Cuban president, Tom·s Estrada Palma in charge. However, already in 1906 - 1909 the U.S. intervened on the grounds of the Platt-Amendment when the liberals campaigned against President Estrada Palma. Further interventions took place in 1912 and between 1917 and 1919. In 1922 the last American soldiers left the island. U.S. investment, especially in sugarcane plantations, brought Cuba a quick economic rise. Nevertheless, the country came into economic dependency of the U.S. and her imports of tobacco and sugar. The agricultural mono-culture was prone to crisis which led to economic disaster during the Great Depression 1929/30. impoverishing large parts of the population. Dictatorial measures taken by President Gerardo Machaldo y Porales (1925 - 1933) were answered by a military coup. Former sergeant and private secretary of Machado, Fulgencio Batista y Zaldivar held the reigns in his position of leader of that revolution and supreme commander of the army. He pushed through the appointment of Carlos Mendieta Montefur as president and achieved the lifting of the Platt-Amendment in 1934. Through the army Batista controlled the government, becoming president in 1940, and installing a dictatorial regime.;;;;;;;;;;X

CTECD_9999;The first intercontinental bombers required massive engines capable of lifting unprecedented weights into the sky and maintaining their power output for extended periods of time.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9996;This heavy bomber aircraft was designed as the first true intercontinental bomber. It was at least twice as large as a heavy bomber and characteristically it conducted high-level attacks against the enemy's industrial complexes and population centers. It had a speed of 610 km/h and a range of 13,000 km, allowing transoceanic bombing missions lasting as long as 24 hours. Examples included the B-36 Peacemaker.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9995;The semi-modern technological achievements in the fields of engine propulsion and heavy airframes could now be designed into a Semi-Modern Intercontinental Bomber Prototype. This prototype had to undergo massive field tests to validate the design. Not until the prototype has been extensively tested can a serial production heavy intercontinental bomber be designed.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9994;This heavy bomber aircraft was designed as the first true supersonic bomber. It had a speed of 1,400km/h and a range of 5000 km. Historically, this was the American B-58 Hustler, and the Russian Tu-22 Blinder.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9993;The first supersonic bombers needed extensive testing before they could be trusted to carry strategic nuclear weapons on deterrence patrols with a high degree of reliability.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9991;This heavy transport aircraft was designed as the first true intercontinental transport. It was at least twice as large as a advanced transport. It had a speed of 600 km/h and a range of 8000 km. Historically, this was the American C-97 Stratofreighter.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9990;The semi-modern technological achievements in the fields of engine propulsion and heavy airframes could now be designed into a Semi-Modern Intercontinental Transport Prototype. This prototype had to undergo massive field tests to validate the design. Not until the prototype has been extensively tested can a serial production heavy intercontinental transport be designed.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9974;This heavy bomber aircraft was designed to function primarily in the role of a strategic bomber with an excellent ground attack capability but no dog-fighting potential. It was at least twice as large as a medium bomber, and characteristically it conducted high-level attacks against the enemy's industrial complexes and population centers. It had an unsurpassed speed of 950 km/h and a range of 5000 km. It had unsurpassed durability, survival and payload capacity.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9811;Supersonic strategic bomber was the effect of post-war fascination of fast, high altitude planes. Faster planes were expected to defend themselves with speed and high altitude, not with defensive weaponry.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9810;Second direction of the strategic bombers evolution was the turbojet propulsion. While employed early on the lighter planes, it was very hard to create engine so fuel efficient to support long range planes.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9809;The Advanced Air Transport was a multi-engine plane capable of carrying troops or cargo across long distances, with specifications typically being 500+ km/h airspeed, and a maximum range of 5000 km. Historically, this was the American C-54 Sky Master.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9808;This heavy bomber aircraft was designed to function primarily in the role of an extremely-long range strategic bomber. It was at least twice as large as a medium bomber, and it had an speed of 950 km/h and a range of 5000 km. Historically, this was the American B-29 Superfortress.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9807;With the war experience and new technologies, evolution of the strategic bombers resulted in long range, high altitude planes, able to deliver their payload without much opposition from the AA weapons and hardly reachable for the fighters.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9804;Advanced medium bombers were much more based on the actual experience than on the pre-war theories. Sturdy, well armed both with defensive and offensive weapons, those planes filled a gap on the operational level between heavy strategic bombers and small planes supporting land troops directly.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9801;Late war designs of light bombers were mostly very practical designs, based on the vast experience gained by the fighting forces.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9703;In the post-war period evolution of the heavy bombers concentrated on the two main directions - long range and conversion on the turbojet propulsion. Intercontinental bomber was the peak of the conventionally propelled bombers - able to reach almost every target on the world, they started new era of strategic air forces.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9702;Constant improvement of the conventional engines resulted in the designs able to provide planes with enough power to reach new speed, acceleration, and climb rates. Those engines were soon out classed by the turbojet designs, but were also much easier to produce.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9550;In an attempt to increase the range and speed of the latest heavy bombers, engineers designed a remotely controlled gun turret that would be controlled and fired from another location using an advanced gyroscopic sight. Historically, these were the Sperry/GE Remote Gun Turrets on the Boeing B-29.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9517;Pressurized cockpit allowed planes to reach higher altitudes, thus giving them security from AA weapons and interceptors. While early planes with that technology were used quite early (modified Ju-86 was used in 1941 to bomb England), practical use of those was delayed to the end war, mainly due to the technological problems and costs.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9516;While first turbojet engines were designed in the late 1930s, their practical use was much delayed thanks to the scale of technological problems with mass production of those. Switching from conventional propeller planes to turbojets was a major change for the whole air industry.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9515;While first turbojet engines were designed in the late 1930s, their practical use was much delayed thanks to the scale of technological problems with mass production of those. Switching from conventional propeller planes to turbojets was a major change for the whole air industry.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9511;The Improved Air Transport was a multi-engine plane capable of carrying troops or cargo across long distances, with specifications typically being 440+ km/h airspeed, and a maximum range of 3,900 km. Historically, this was the American C-54 Skymaster.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9510;The Improved Heavy Bomber was a multi-engine plane capable of carrying bombs across long distances, with specifications typically being 470+ km/h airspeed, and a maximum range of 3,200 km. Historically, this was the German He-177 Greif.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9509;Early heavy bombers were not 'decisive weapon' - underestimated fighters were too effective to allow planes like Wellington's and DB-3f's attack their targets freely. New generation of heavy bombers was the answer for that - 4-engined, sturdy planes with massive defensive armament.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9506;At the end of 1930s, new concept of bombers become very popular among the military theorists - 'fast bomber'. Those medium bombers were designed to defend themselves with the speed, not the guns. While the idea totally underestimated fighter threat, it was employed by many major air forces, Luftwaffe including. Nevertheless, those planes were much more advanced then earlier models of medium bombers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9503;After the field test first models of modern light bombers, serious modifications took place. Improved light bombers had better bomb capacity, sturdier construction and more advanced avionics, making them more capable to provide effective support to the units below.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9409;Early attempts to build jet engine resulted in various designs, giving some valuable experience needed to build proper engine. Historically, those were represented by HeS 3B turbojet engine used in He-178 (first flight - 24th August 1939).;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9408;Supercharger was the special compressor, allowing engines to keep their power high even in low pressure conditions. Thanks to that planes were able to operate on the very high altitudes, thus gaining safety from AA fire and low older models of fighters.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9407;Using hi-octane fuel allowed planes to get more power from their engines, without the need to redesigning them much. It also meant, that air force using those had bigger fuel consumption. Historically, hi-octane fuel was used by American USAAF.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9403;Supercharged engines, able to support both light and heavy planes on both low and high altitudes, allowed development of new air strategies and tactics.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9402;Those powerful engines, using new fuels and all the early war improvements, were able to support whole range of the new, improved planes.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9401;Those engines were direct evolution of previous ones. While not really powerful, those were still a major step to improve performance of the existing planes.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9309;Bombs like 'Tall Boy', with their weight way over 5000 kg, were ultimate conventional weapons. Used only on the most important targets, dropped by British Lancaster strategic bombers, 'Tall Boys' had a devastating effect on their targets.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9308;This bomb type was designed to permanently destroy important, hard-to-destroy targets, like bunker complexes and other fortifications. Introduced as the armament of British strategic bombers, those bombs were employed in the attacks on the German dams, U-boat pens, fortifications and fortified supply depots.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9307;Idea of putting armor on the planes was first introduced on the fighters, but it use was limited due to the negative effect on the performance. In case of close support plane survivability was way more important. First plane with serious elements of armor was Soviet Il-2 'Sturmovik', also called 'Flying tank'.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9306;Early Air-to-Surface rockets were first employed by the Soviets as the armament of their Il-2 'Shturmovik'. M-82 rocket (same as used on the 'Katyusha' mobile rocket launcher) was very effective against infantry, but far too inaccurate to provide serious threat against armored targets.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9304;This bomb type was designed to penetrate through several meters of structure before detonating. It was a very effective weapon against bunkers and fortifications. It was also very effective against armored naval targets, like battleships and aircraft carriers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9303;The Dive-Drop Bomb Shell was streamlined to perfect the straight line of the movement of the shell.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9301;Radio Navigation enabled aircraft to receive two or more radio beam signals from friendly territory. These radio beams would transmit from two or more separate sites with a sufficient distance between them. The radio beams would be aimed over an enemy target to intersect exactly over the target area. Historically, this was the British Gee and the German Knickebein and Lorenz systems.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9209;Most advanced glider projects allowed transportation of the light vehicles. While light tanks were sometimes (but rarely) the case, light vehicles, like jeeps, gave airborne units serious advantage by providing them with fast moving, recon vehicles.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9208;With the development of bigger gliders, airborne units gained ability to transport heavier weapons. While standard, field artillery was still out of range, more compact artillery pieces were air-transported by the gliders.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9201;Basic glider designs allowed airborne units to fight their main weakness - confusion and dispersion of forces para-dropped randomly over the big area. Glider infantry, deployed whole, organized squads, thus seriously boosting organization of the unit in the first, critical phase of battle.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9109;The Basic Air Transport was a multi-engine plane capable of carrying troops or cargo across long distances, with specifications typically being 370+ km/h airspeed, and a maximum range of 2,400 km. Historically, this was the American C-47 Skytrain.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9108;The Basic Strategic Bomber was a multi-engine plane capable of carrying bombs across long distances, with specifications typically being 400+ km/h airspeed, and a maximum range of 1,200 km. Historically, this was the US B-17 Flying Fortress.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9107;Concept of the heavy bomber was the effect of interwar fascination with bombers as the 'decisive weapon'. While many theorists believed that static warfare of the Great War will be recreated in the next wars, they also believed that heavy and medium bombers will be able to win the war alone by bombing production and supply centers of the enemy. Following that doctrine, United Kingdom and USA both had at the start of war designs for heavy bombers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9104;Concept of the medium bomber was the effect of interwar fascination with bombers as the 'decisive weapon'. While many theorists believed that static warfare of the Great War will be recreated in the next wars, they also believed that heavy and medium bombers will be able to win the war alone by bombing production and supply centers of the enemy. In German doctrine medium bombers had different tasks - their attacks on the supply lines and mobilization centers were designed to disrupt enemy troops and support Werhmacht's 'Blitzkrieg'.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9101;Concept of the light, one-seat bomber was developed straight from the Great War experiences. It was constantly developed during the interwar period, and reached it's peak in German concept of dive bomber, designed to directly support fast, armored troops. Same concept allowed Soviets to develop 'shturmovik plane' - armored and armed with heavy guns and rockets. Light bombers were also employed by naval air forces, giving effective support as torpedo planes and dive bombers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9011;Most nations developed artillery spotter aircraft equipped with wireless radio, which were far more effective than their Great War contemporaries.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9007;Bomb was developed during the Great War, as a demand for more effective air-to-ground weapon then guns and hand grenades. After the war it was further developed to provide both bigger blast range and improved accuracy.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9003;Those engines outclassed earlier designs, providing new planes with enough power to gain better maximum speed, acceleration and climb rate.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9002;To fight low power of engines, fuel-injection systems were designed. By supporting engine with pressurized fuel, engineers achieved greater power without serious modifications of the whole project.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9001;Those engines were enough to support most of the pre-war designs of planes. While good for a start, their power soon were not enough to work with heavier, more advanced planes.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_8955;The first nuclear weapons were huge, unwieldy devices that weighed 10,000+ pounds. The next generation of nuclear weapons was much smaller, weighing 6,700 pounds. Historically, this was the American Mk. 5 weapon. Once researching this technology, you will be able to arm flying rockets with nuclear warheads.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_8950;The second generation of nuclear weapons were still huge devices. The third generation of nuclear weapons was significantly smaller, weighing only 1,700 pounds. Historically, this was the American Mk. 7 weapon. Once researching this technology, you will be able to arm flying bombs with nuclear warheads.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_7975;The second generation of rocket engines had longer ranges than the first generation, due to more advanced propellants, both solid and liquid. Historically, this was the German Walter HWK 109-509C-4 rocket.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_7974;The improved flying bomb was superior to the early models in every aspect, from warhead carried to speed and range. Historically, this was the American TM-61 Matador built after the war based on the V-1.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_7802;The first turbojets suffered from excessive engine wear and low range. With the experience from the first turbojets in mind, a newer, more reliable engine could now be designed. Historically, this was the German Junkers Jumo 004B Turbojet engine.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_7800;The second generation of turbojet and rocket engines corrected many of the flaws found in the early models, such as limited durability and excessive fuel consumption, and reduced those problems to acceptable limits.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6998;The development of the naval nuclear power plant enables long range designs to be developed.  The primary weapon of these cruisers is their long range surface-to-air missile system.  The nuclear power plant replaces the gas turbines in conventionally powered guided missile cruisers.  This requires the hull to be lengthened to provide the additional space.  Historically, this was the US Long Beach-class and US Bainbridge-class nuclear powered guided missile cruisers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6997;This cruiser is designed primarily for the anti-aircraft protection of taskforces.  The main weapons are two long range surface-to-air missile systems.  These missile systems are fed from magazines within the hull.  a few 127mm (5 inch) guns provide limited anti-surface ability and provide a short range back-up for the missile system.  Gas turbines give the new design high speed and the ability to rapidly accelerate and decelerate.  Historically, this was the US Albany-class and French Colbert-class guided missile cruisers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6996;The development of the shipboard nuclear power plant allows new long range designs to be developed.  These ships are redesigned super cruisers.  The main change is the replacement of the boilers with nuclear reactors.  The lightweight 305mm (12 inch) guns are the primary feature of this design.  Although these ships look like battleships externally, their single rudder and aircraft facilities show their cruiser ancestry.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6995;The development of a nuclear power plant for naval vessel allows new long range designs to be developed.  These are redesigned post-treaty heavy cruisers.  The boilers are replaced with nuclear reactors.  To accommodate the reactors, internal changes need to be made.  The nuclear power plant allows these ships to be underway without refueling practically indefinitely.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6994;The development of the shipboard nuclear power plant allows new designs to be created.  These are post-treaty light cruisers fitted with nuclear reactors in place of boilers.  Internal changes have to be made to make room for the reactors.  This requires the shifting of magazines and other internal spaces within the design.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6993;This a destroyer designed to screen taskforces and convoys from air attacks.  The primary weapon is a long range surface-to-air missile system mounted on the stern.  Gas turbine engines give these destroyers high speed.  A 127mm (5 inch) gun provides anti-surface firepower and provides a short range back-up for the missile system.  Historically, this was the Soviet Kotlin-class and US Charles F. Adams-class guided missile destroyers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6992;As the war progresses, more equipment is added to existing destroyers.  The increased weight is causing stability problems for older destroyers.  A new destroyer design is needed with the size to provide space for new systems.  These destroyers carry five or six 127mm (5 inch) guns and torpedoes.  They are equipped with extensive anti-submarine weapons and sensors.  Historically, this was the US Forrest Sherman-class destroyers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6991;This is a conventionally powered destroyer design.  Armed with up to six guns in multiple gun mounts, they are able to attack enemy vessels or protect the fleet against air attack.  Historically this was the US Allen M. Sumner-class and British Battle-class destroyers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6990;The high speed of new submarines require a vessel that can accelerate and stop quickly.  The new frigate is a single screw design with a gas turbine.  These ships have extensive anti-submarine sensors and weapons.  They only carry limited weapons for anti-surface or anti-aircraft warfare.  Historically, this was the US Claude Jones-class and Soviet Riga-class frigates.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6989;This design was once thought to be the ultimate in merchant vessels.  Owners wouldn't have to purchase fuel, the primary cost while running a merchant vessel.  The cost of the specialized engineering crew necessary to run the nuclear reactor increase the crewing costs.  This limits the usefulness of the nuclear merchant vessel in commercial service.  These ships are still useful if ultra-long range is required.  Historically, this was the N/V Savannah.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6988;These are the warship designs that are going to serve in the post-war navies.  Guided missiles and nuclear propulsion increase the capability of the new warships.  These new designs incorporate the latest in electronics for detection and attack of enemy ships and submarines.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6987;As aircraft landing speeds increase, the ability of a landing signaling officer standing on the stern of the carrier to judge the approach and signal corrections to the pilot decreased.  The solution is to set up a device that automatically signals the corrections to the pilot.  The device is made up of lenses and mirrors which project a 'ball' which lets the pilot know if he is above or below the proper landing angle.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6986;The development of the angled flight deck means that aircraft are gunning their engines as they cross the deck in case of a missed pass.  This means that the arrestor wires need to be able to withstand the additional force.  The arrestor wires and hydraulics below deck need to be able to bring the aircraft to a stop and hold it in place until the engines are throttled down.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6985;The hydraulic catapult used on carriers is limited in the size of aircraft that can be launched.  This is a function of the size of the hydraulic system.  A steam catapult uses high pressure steam diverted from the ship's boilers to launch the aircraft.  The steam pressure is used to propel a shuttle down the track.  The aircraft, attached to the shuttle, is accelerated to flight speed.  The steam catapult is readily increasable to launch heavier aircraft.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6984;The development of the angled flight deck means that simultaneous operations are possible.  This means that aircraft have to be moved around the deck more often.  Aircraft moving tractors with larger engines to move larger aircraft around the deck.  Specialized rearming vehicles load the new generation of guided munitions onto the aircraft.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6983;As the speed of aircraft have increased, it has become more difficult to safely recover aircraft.  The traditional way to stop an aircraft that has missed the arrestor wires is a wire barrier strung across the deck.  With the high speed of newer aircraft, the barrier is unable to prevent the plane from hitting aircraft parked on the forward deck.  By adding a sponson to the port side of the hull, the flight deck can be expanded and angled.  The angled deck allows aircraft that miss the arrestor wires to circle around and attempt another landing.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6982;The use of jets and heavy aircraft changes the way that aircraft are handled on aircraft carriers.  The higher speed of the jet, while valuable in the air, causes problems with recovery onboard the carrier.  New methods for recovery and deck logistics need to be developed.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6981;The use of helicopters allows a small warship to increase the range at which it can detect and attack a submarine. The destroyer is modified with a helideck aft to operate the helicopters.  This requires the removal of the aft guns.  The helicopter carries sonobuoys and depth charges which allow it to detect and attack submarines.  Operations off a small warship requires aviation fuel and extra depth charges to be carried.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6980;Coordination between aircraft and surface ships requires extensive practice to work.  The surface ship and aircraft share sensor information.  When a submarine is detected, the shared information enables the submarine to be localized and attacked.  One aircraft can coordinate with numerous surface ships.  The aircraft will use superior speed to investigate questionable targets.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6979;The increasing speed of submarines makes it more important to engage the submarine away from the convoy or fleet.  New weapon systems allow the anti-submarine battle to be extended out away from the convoy or fleet.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6978;Advances in submarine technology mean that new tactics have to be developed.  Submarines are faster and can operate for longer periods while submerged.  The submarines need to be attacked while they are away from the convoy.  This allows the convoy to use superior speed to get past submerged submarines.  The new tactics move the anti-submarine battle away from the submarine.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6977;When the process of nuclear fission was discovered, it was realized that it would be effective for propelling submarines and ships.  A reactor has to be modified to fit within the confined space of an engine room.  The water is heated within the reactor and run through a steam generator.  This allows non-radioactive steam to be made to drive a traditional geared turbine.  The radioactive water is pumped back into the reactor as coolant to resume the steam generation cycle.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6970;Further developments in the field of electronics make improvements in naval warships possible.  These improvements included better radars, nuclear propulsion, and guided missiles.  The range at which battles take place is increasing.  Battles where the combatants don't see one another have become common.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6969;The gas turbine is a turbojet engine modified to for use in a naval vessel.  The engine is made much larger so that it will work on standard diesel fuel in place of highly volatile jet fuel.  The turbine draws in large quantities of air to mix with the diesel fuel.  The engine is connected to the propeller shaft through a set of gears.  This allows the engine to be run at the most efficient speed without causing cavitation.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6968;The automation of the steam plant allows the engineering crew to be reduced.  Sensors within the boiler regulate the flow of fuel and air into the boiler.  Improvements in design of the burners within the boiler mean that they have to pulled out and changed less often.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6967;Advances in technology have enabled advances in the field of marine engineering.  Steam has been the standard for most propulsion systems since it replaced sails.  The development of the jet engine has created a new alternative power source.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6966;A torpedo is boosted out towards a distant target by a rocket motor.  When the rocket reaches the proper range a self-homing torpedo is dropped into the water where it can attack the enemy submarine.  This allows attacks on submarines before they can close with the convoy or fleet.  Historically, this was the US ASROC system.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6965;This torpedo combines the surface torpedo homing system with a shaped warhead to get a powerful weapon.  This torpedo can be used against both surface targets and submarines.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6964;A shaped warhead sends a superheated jet of plasma burning into the target vessel.  This allows the warhead to create holes in layered defense systems consisting of layers of tanks.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6963;This system allows torpedoes to use sonar signals to home in on a target.  The homing is controlled by an operator on the firing vessel through a small wire which is trailed behind the torpedo.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6962;This is a short range missile system designed for the defense of a single vessel.  This system is made up of a launcher and illuminator that can be mounted on a small warship.  The mount carries a limited number of missiles which have to be reloaded from a separate magazine when the mount is empty.  These missiles are powered by a small, solid rocket motor.  Historically this was the US Terrier and UK Tigercat missile systems.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6961;This long range missile system allows incoming aircraft to be destroyed before they can attack.  The long range properties of the missile allow a single vessel to provide anti-aircraft coverage for the entire fleet.  A rocket motor boosts the missile away from the vessel and accelerates it to a speed where the ramjet engine will operate.  The mount is fed from a below deck magazine automatically when the mount is empty.  Historically, this was the US Talos system or Soviet SA-N-1 Goa surface-to air missile system.  This missile system is too large to be mounted onboard a vessel as a retrofit, a specially designed vessel is required.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6960;This a missile with a large warhead designed to attack other vessels out to the horizon.  The missile is limited in range to the horizon due to the requirement that it homes on a reflected radar signal from the firing vessel.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6959;The illuminator is the control system for anti-aircraft guided missiles.  The illuminator consists of the control station and the guidance radar.  The control station controls the launcher and aiming of the guidance radar.  The radar sends out a focused signal that the missile uses to home on the target.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6958;The illuminator is the guidance system for anti-ship guided missiles.  The illuminator consists of a control station and a radar.  The radar antenna sends out a focused signal which the missile home in on.  The control station controls the launcher and aiming of the missile.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6957;The first fire control computers were simple mechanical computers.  The design limitations of the mechanical computer mean that a limited number of variables can be taken into account while making the calculation.  With the development of an electronic computer, more variables can be incorporated in to the fire control solution.  Electronic fire control computers take into account variables like barrel wear, barrel droop, sea state, target relative motion and variable shell weights.  This makes the fire control solution more accurate.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6956;Improvements in director technology allow small directors to be built.  These directors are used for controlling light anti-aircraft guns.  The use of a more advanced mechanical computer allows the fire control solution to be made more accurate.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6955;These small, lightly armored directors are more effective than their predecessors because of their use of basic computers to provide tracking of targets.  These directors also are powerful enough to serve as the main battery directors for cruisers and other similarly sized warships.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6954;The combination of small computers with advanced optics allows accurate control of weapons.  Guidance systems for missiles and smaller directors for guns are a result in the improved technology.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6953;Denying the enemy the use of electronics and radars is an important part of combat operations.  These jammers jam a wide range of radar and control signals by sending out 'white noise' on radio frequencies.  The 'white noise' creates lines and fuzz on enemy radar screens.  It also disrupts control signals for guided weapons.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6952;Improvements in the transducers used to create the ASDIC/sonar signal allow the use of lower frequency sound waves.  This allows for long range detection in deep water.  The lower frequency signal penetrates the temperature layer that exist in deep water.  Computers allow filtering of the signal to remove false targets.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6951;The integration of computers and advanced antenna design make the radar more effective.  Computers allow the radar signal to be filtered.  This allows detection of surface contacts in confined waters and rainy weather.  The improved antenna design gives better range and target resolution.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6950;The integration of computers and an advanced antenna design makes radar more effective.  Computers allow the radar signal to be filtered to remove 'noise' and improve clarity.  The improved antenna design increases the range that aircraft can be detected.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6949;Advances in electronics allow the range of combat to be increased.  Better sensors and systems allow individual warships to cover more area.  The increased capability makes new warships more expensive and increase the cost of restocking weapons.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6948;Experience with carrier operations showed that more survivability can be built into a large carrier.  A larger hull supports an armored flight deck and more anti-aircraft guns.  The size means that a larger air group can be carried.  Historically, this was the US Midway-class and Japanese Shinano-class aircraft carriers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6947;Cruiser hulls can be converted into small aircraft carriers.  A flight deck and hanger are built on the main deck of the hull.  The armor belt is removed as compensation for the additional weight of the structure built on the hull.  These carriers are designed to be built quickly and supplement fleet carriers.  Historically, this was the US Independence-class and Japanese Chitose-class light carriers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6946;These are merchant hulls converted to operate limited air wings in support of convoys or amphibious operations.  The merchant hull means that there is no armor protection and limited top speed.  Because of their small size, escort carriers carry limited guns for defense against air and surface attacks.  Historically, this was the US Casablanca-class and British Ruler-class escort carriers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6945;The super battleship designs started as hypothetical designs to find the limits of battleship design.  The 460mm (18 inch) guns are the heaviest gun mounted on warship.  The belt and deck armor is very thick to resist heavy shells and bombs.  These ships trade speed for their heavy guns and armor.  Historically, this was the Japanese Yamato-class battleships.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6940;With the end of restrictions from the Washington Naval Treaty, many nations upgraded their designs to take advantage of greater available weight and size.  Much of the weight will go into improving the armor protection.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6939;The removal of the limitations on battleship tonnage imposed by the Washington Treaty results in larger battleship designs.  A new model of 406mm (16 inch) gun allows more guns to be mounted.  A heavy armor belt gives these battleships the ability to withstand fire from other battleships armed with 406mm guns.  Historically, this was the US Montana-class and German Bismarck-class battleships.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6938;The Washington Naval Treaty limited cruisers to 203mm (8 inch) guns.  With the relaxation of the treaty limits, a cruiser with 305mm guns can be designed.  Although they look like battleships, they are designed to cruiser standards.  The catapults are mounted amidships and there is only a single rudder.  A new model of lightweight 305mm gun is the main battery gun selected for the new design.  Historically, this was the US Alaska-class large cruisers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6937;With the removal of the limitations imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty, designers can improve the level of protection.  The armor belt is made thick enough to withstand hits from 203mm (8 inch) shells.  A new turret design makes the main battery more flexible.  Individual gun slides allow the guns to elevate independently.  Historically, this was the US Baltimore-class heavy cruisers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6936;This cruiser is designed to protect capital ships from air attack.  They are also designed to serve as flagships for destroyer flotillas.  These cruisers are armed with multiple dual purpose 127mm mounts.  Because of the small caliber of their main battery, their effectiveness in attacks against traditional cruisers is limited.  Historically, this was the US Atlanta-class and British Dido-class light cruisers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6935;The removal of the Washington Treaty limit of 10,000 standard tons for cruisers allow a balanced designs to be created.  The armor belt is made thicker to resist long range gunfire.  The longer hull allows the engineering plant to be split into separate spaces to resist damage.  Historically, this was the US Cleveland-class and British Fiji-class light cruisers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6934;The relaxation of the limits of the Washington Naval Treaty means that destroyers can have a standard displacement greater than 1500 tons.  These destroyers have five or six 127mm (5 inch) guns and a large torpedo battery.  Frames which run the entire length of the hull give these destroyers the ability to withstand more damage than previous designs.  Historically, this was the US Fletcher-class and Japanese Kagero-class destroyers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6933;This is a small, easily produced escort vessel.  Corvettes are typically armed with two or three small guns and an extensive battery of ASW weaponry.  Diesel engines give these escorts sufficient range to accompany convoys of transoceanic routes.  Historically, this was the UK River-class and US Evert-class escorts.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6932;This is a specialized vessel designed for transporting troops in a combat zone.  They have limited means for defending themselves against enemy planes and warships.  Additional hull framing gives these ships the ability to absorb limited damage.  Historically, this was the US Henderson-class transports.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6931;Attacks by submarines meant that merchant vessels in convoys are being sunk at alarming rates.  A simple, mass producible ships is required to keep the trade routes open.  These vessels have simple steam plants and either a reciprocating or turbine engine depending on availability.  Simple construction techniques make these vessel fragile.  Historically, this was the US Liberty ships.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6930;These merchant vessels were initially designed to transport high value, perishable cargoes.  A pair of high pressure boilers and a geared steam turbine allow these ships to achieve high speed for a merchant vessel.  These ships typically have an amidships or forward house and five or six cargo holds.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6929;This radar is designed to work with secondary battery directors.  The antenna mounts to the secondary director and is useful in targeting both aircraft and surface ships.  The accuracy of the centimetric radar allows true blind fire if the target is obscured by smoke or darkness.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6928;The development of centimetric radar allows fire control radar sets to be made smaller and more accurate.  The radar antenna is mounted on the main battery director and gives an accurate range and bearing to the target.  The improved accuracy of the centimetric radar allows true blind fire.  The design of this radar is optimized for use against surface targets.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6927;This is the first generation of fire control radar.  The radar attaches to the front of the director and allows the ship to get an accurate range to the target, even if the target is obscured by haze or smoke.  This radar is not accurate enough to get a bearing on the target, so true blind fire is not possible.  The antenna is heavy and can only be mounted on battleships.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6926;These are small, disposable ASDIC/sonar transducers that can be dropped by an aircraft into the area where a submarine is suspected to be.  A small radio transmits the returning data to an operator on the aircraft.  Once the position of the submarine is determined, the plane can attack the enemy submarine.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6925;These are small, disposable ASDIC/sonar transducers dropped over the side of the vessel.  The transducer to able get beneath the layer where a sharp changes in temperature tend to reflect ASDIC/Sonar signals.  These small transducers are inexpensive enough to be disposable.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6924;A towed hydrophone is made up of multiple transducers towed at the end of a long cable pulled behind the destroyer.  This allows passive detection of submarines while the vessel is underway.  With hull mounted sonar, the engines create enough noise to cover the noise of a quiet submarine.  A towed sonar allows the transducers to be far enough from the engines and propellers to enable them to hear submarines while underway.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6923;The use of multiple transducers allows the ASDIC/Sonar to be 'steered' on target without physically turning a piece of equipment.  This is made possible by electronics which analyze multiple signals and combine them into a single signal.  This allows the operator manipulate to manipulate the signal to make submarine detection easier.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6922;The small wavelength of centimetric radar allows the operator to 'see through' surface clutter and bad weather with more clarity.  The wavelength also allows better distinction between multiple targets.  Centimetric radar sets are small enough to be mounted on small warships which were unable to mount the heavier decimetric radar.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6921;The reduction in the wavelength of radar signals allows the antenna to be made smaller.  This allows small warships to mount effective air search radar.  The smaller wavelength also allows the operator to distinguish between individual aircraft on the screen.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6920;Many of the improvements in electronics have gradually found their way into the specialized field of marine electronics.  Smaller radar antennas have enabled radar to be incorporated into more systems.  Improved electronics have also been incorporated into anti-submarine equipment.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6919;This is a simple mechanical computer mounted deep within the vessel.  Simple switches allow the crew to enter the variables of range, speed and deflection.  A mechanical computer uses the variables to calculate a fire control solution.  The solution is transmitted to the director where the aim of the guns is adjusted.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6918;These small directors are mounted to control the medium and light anti-aircraft guns.  These directors consist of set of control handles and a simple sight.  By tracking the target, lead information is calculated and transmitted to the anti-aircraft guns.  These directors are small enough to be mounted in overlapping fields of coverage.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6917;The same technology that allows improvements to be made in main battery director can be applied to directors designed for controlling secondary guns.  These directors are fitted with a rangefinder and simple computer to allow calculation of the proper firing solution.  These directors are also used for controlling the guns against aircraft.  These directors have only a lightweight shield to protect the crew and equipment in the director from shell splinters.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6916;Main battery directors are mounted high in the vessel to give long range visibility.  The director is able to control and fire the main battery turrets remotely.  By controlling all of the guns from a central location, the firing of the guns can be timed to fire at the perfect time in the ships roll.  This allows for accurate fire at long range.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6915;Optics have become more precise as manufacturing processes improve.  Optics now can be mounted in directors and turrets that allow engaging targets at night and in reduced visibility.  Turret optics are now advanced enough that 'long base' rangefinders can be mounted in the turret to facilitate local control in the event of damage to the director.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6914;Better manufacturing techniques and improved electronics allow better control systems for weapons systems to be developed.  The use of radar is now available for use in solving the range portion of the fire control solution.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6913;This system fires small, contact fused depth charges ahead of the vessel.  The contact fuse removes doubt as to whether or not an attack is effective.  If there is no explosion, the charges have missed their target and a follow-up attack can be made.  Firing the charges ahead allows a single destroyer to make an attack while still tracking the target.  Historically, this was the Mousetrap ASW system.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6912;High frequency direction finders (Huff Duff) allow a vessel to get a bearing to a transmitting radio.  An antenna in the shape of a loop is rotated until the signal strength is the strongest.  The bearing to the transmitting submarine is plotted on a chart.  If more than one vessel gets a bearing, it allows the position of the transmitting submarine to be triangulated and then investigated.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6911;Multiple destroyers working together are more effective for destroying enemy submarines than a single destroyer.  Tactics for the coordination of attacks has taken time to develop.  The most efficient method is for one destroyer to track the submarine while another destroyer makes an attack.  During attacks with a single destroyer, contact with the submarine is lost just before the destroyer passes over the submarine.  By using the second destroyer, contact isn't lost at the time of an attack allowing for faster follow-up attacks.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6910;Flying boats are converted to make anti-submarine patrol aircraft.  The planes are fitted with depth charges racks for attacking submarines.  Flare dispensers allow attacks to be made against submarines on the surface at night.  The long range of the flying boats allows convoys to have air cover farther out to sea.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6909;As was the war continues, experience in hunting and destroying submarines continues to increase.  Submarines are slower while operating submerged.  If the escorts can force the submarine to submerge, it limits the search area.  Even if the submarine isn't destroyed, the slow speed of the submerged submarine ensures that the convoy can escape.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6908;As crews get more experience in hunting and destroying enemy submarines, improvements to the systems used in ASW are developed.  The new technology is designed to combat the massed submarine attacks that are common in 'wolfpack' tactics.  These new systems can detect the submarine and allow faster attacks before the submarine can evade.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6816;Amphibious assaults require large quantities of supplies.  Until a port is secured, supplies have to be brought across the beach from ships offshore.  Amphibious vehicles are more effective because of their ability to drive up onto the beach before unloading the supplies.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6815;Amphibious operations require command facilities that can monitor both the battle ashore and the surrounding sea area.  Merchant ships are converted to add extensive communications equipment.  Cargo holds are converting into spaces for planning and controlling operations on shore.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6814;These are infantry landing craft modified to fire rockets and guns in support of troops on shore.  They get close to shore with their shallow draft and reinforced bows.  Firing concentrated salvoes of rockets at targets of opportunity targeted by spotters ashore allows the troops on shore to advance easier.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6813;The Landing Ship (Tank) allows vehicles to land directly onto an unprepared beach.  The LST pushes her bow up on the beach and extends a ramp allowing the vehicles to drive directly into combat.  These vessels can also transport cavalry directly into combat without waiting for horses to arrive separately.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6812;The use of specialized landing craft allows troops to land with armor protection.  Landing craft get the troops on shore without crossing the beach under fire.  These craft can also land a limited amount of supplies across the beach.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6811;Coordinated naval gunfire is made possible by detailed fire support plans and communications with troops on shore.  Specially trained spotters with the troops radio targets and corrections to ships offshore.  This allows efficient fire at targets of opportunity.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6810;As the war progresses, nations have discovered that they need specialized forces for scouting and preparing enemy beaches.  The British created the Special Boat Service (SBS) and the US created the UDT divers.  These forces make it easier for the marines following them to succeed in their assaults.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6800;The use of electronics became more important in the field of naval combat.  It also allowed for detection at longer ranges.  This meant that the combat happened at longer ranges as well.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6746;The protection of carriers takes many forms.  With a new generation of fleet carriers, the new design has to be updated with an armored flight deck that is important for protection.  Unfortunately, this design carries fewer aircraft than carriers without the armored flight deck.  This is done because of the limitations in stability and space that occur as a result of the armored flight deck.  Historically, this was the British Malta-class and Japanese Taiho-class aircraft carriers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6745;The relaxation of the tonnage limits with the Washington Naval Treaty means that more capable carriers can be designed and built.  One of the improvements incorporated is a more robust engineering plant.  The concept allows 'split plant' operation.  This means the destruction of any single engineering space does not incapacitate the carrier.  There are also advantages in the fact that these carriers are bigger than their predecessors.  Historically, this was the US Essex-class and Japanese Unryu-class aircraft carriers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6744;The protection of carriers from attack is always a difficult question.  Carriers by their very nature are required to carry large quantities of flammable materials.  One solution to protecting carriers is the armored flight deck.  A traditional carrier has a protective deck under the hanger to protect the engineering spaces and the magazines.  These carriers add a second layer of armor at the flight deck.  This second layer of armor provides additional protection from bombs.  Unfortunately, this reduces the size of the air group that can be carried aboard due to stability considerations and space limitations.  Historically, this was the British Illustrious-class aircraft carriers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6743;Experimentation with converted carriers resulted in designs for carriers built specifically for that purpose.  The first carriers are intended to act as scouting and support elements for the traditional battleline of battleships.  As the their tactics evolve, they have become independent strike units.  These carriers have lightweight decks and limited armor protection to optimize the number of aircraft that can be carried.  Historically, this was the British Ark Royal-class, US Yorktown-class, and Japanese Shokaku-class carriers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6742;During the 1930s, many nations looked at building a hybrid cruiser-carrier to supplement their carrier tonnage which was limited by the Washington Naval Treaty.  Aviation cruiser designs typically have two or three turrets with 152mm (6 inch) guns forward.  A small flight deck and island are placed on the stern in place of the after turrets.  They have a limited air group with 28 aircraft, but also have armor on the scale of contemporary light cruisers.  All of the countries that have looked at the design determined that it is not a worthwhile use of limited cruiser tonnage.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6741;The Washington Naval Treaty contains provisions that when a non-signatory power builds a battleship that exceeds treaty limits, the limits will be increased.  With the refusal of the Japanese to renew the treaty, the limits are expanded to a standard displacement of 45,000 tons.  The additional displacement allows for a higher design speed.  A small length to beam ratio is achieved by lengthening the design.  This means that the same power is able to achieve higher speed.  Unfortunately, it means that there is now more hull area that needs to be armored.  This means that the increase in speed is bought at no increase in armor protection or armament.  Historically, this was the US Iowa-class battleships.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6740;When an object made out of metal is placed in a magnetic field, the metal distorts the magnetic field lines.  This principle is used to detect submarines (metal) when operating (Earth's magnetic Field) submerged.  A very sensitive magnetic compass is carried which detects the subtle changes in the Earth's magnetic field that occur as the result of the submarine's metal hull.  These changes are very small so the detector has to be close to the submarine.  This means the submarine has to be operating at a shallow depth to be detected.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6737;The development of the automatic 203mm (8 inch) gun helps keep the heavy cruiser as a viable design.  The problem with other heavy cruiser designs is the slowness of the main battery fire.  The slowness of fire makes it difficult to engage targets that are maneuvering or at close range.  The new 203mm gun is combined with a larger hull and better protection in an entirely new design.  Historically, this was the US Oregon City-class heavy cruisers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6736;The dual purpose 152mm (6 inch) gun has been on the drawing boards since before the war.  The priority of other projects delayed the development.  With the completion of the gun design, new anti-aircraft cruisers can be developed.  The twin turrets are larger than the twin 127mm (5 inch) mounts they replace.  This requires the hull to be lengthened to accommodate the new turrets.  Historically, this was the US Worcester-class and British Tiger-class light cruisers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6735;The blimp, equipped with magnetic anomaly detection gear and depth charges, is an effective antisubmarine warfare platform.  The blimp has excellent visibility over the convoy and greater speed than any contemporary convoy escort.  This allows the blimp to fly to the area from which a torpedo attack occurred to prosecute a counter-attack on the enemy submarine.  Historically, this was the US 'K' class blimps.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6734;Enormous rigid airships like the Hindenburg and Akron proved dangerously fragile and subject to loss from fire and inclement weather.  Small blimps, airships without an aluminum inner skeleton, are more robust operationally, although they have a smaller payload than the big airships.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6733;Increasing the diameter of the torpedo from the standard 533mm (21 inch) to 610mm (24 inch) allows the torpedo to be made more powerful.  The additional volume within the torpedo body allows a large warhead to be combined with longer range.  This makes the torpedo a very effective weapon.  The increased size of the torpedo means that the torpedo tubes have to modified in an extensive overhaul.  Historically, this was the Japanese 'Long Lance' torpedo.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6732;The increasing speed and weight of naval aircraft means that the equipment used for stopping them on deck has to be made stronger.  The hydraulic rams are made larger to absorb more energy.  The wire ropes themselves are also made thicker the withstand the increased stresses.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6731;As aircraft get larger, the amount of space that they take up on deck increased.  This means that aircraft have to be moved around the deck more often than in the past.  Specialized handling tractors are developed to move aircraft around the deck quicker.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6730;Directional homing beacons send out coded radio signals.  As the bearing back to the ship changes, a received Morse code letter changes.  This allows aircraft to find their way back to the carrier from long ranges.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6729;The system for aviation gasoline (avgas) on the carrier is vulnerable to damage, fire, and explosions.  By moving the pipes outside of the hull and installing a system that fills the pipes with carbon dioxide, it reduces the threat of exploding fuel vapors.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6728;During the early years of the war many nations looked at converting available light cruiser hulls into aircraft carriers to get carriers quickly into the fleet.  These are complex conversions.  The main battery magazines are converted to magazines for bombs and torpedoes and fuel storage created within the hull.  The hangar and flight deck are built up on the hull and a small island is added.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6727;During the early years of the war nations looked at converting readily available merchant vessels into aircraft carriers.  These conversions are simple.  Moving the stacks and engine intakes to the edges of the deck and adding a flight deck and hanger to the existing main deck.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6726;Advances in general aviation eventually made their way into the specialized field of naval aviation.  Naval warplanes have become lighter, faster and more maneuverable.  This means facilities on the carrier have to be improved to maintain and operate these more advanced aircraft.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6725;Superheated steam is created by running the steam through the boiler a second time.  Superheating removes all of the water from the steam resulting in 'dry steam.' Superheating the steam allows more heat energy to be added to the steam.  Hotter steam is more efficient in driving the turbines.  The 'dry steam' is better for equipment by limiting corrosion.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6724;The use of a diesel engine to drive a generator means that emergency generators can be mounted in spaces outside of the engine room.  These generators are tied into separate buses where power can be provided to critical systems.  Back-up power can be provided to gun mounts and electronics in the event of damage to the engine spaces.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6723;A diesel engine allows damage control equipment to be spread around the vessel.  The diesel engine can be mounted in a space that is unconnected to the engine spaces.  A large centrifugal pump is tied into the fire main.  This allows the fire main to be broken into zones to protect against damage, but also allow the pump to pressurize the entire system in the event of damage to the engine spaces.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6722;Improvements in marine engineering have improved the redundancy and efficiency of warships.  The importance of damage control means that most of the focus of new engineering designs is focused on increasing survivability.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6721;VHF (Very High Frequency) radios allow instantaneous communications between ships within visual range.  The small radio sets are mounted on the bridge where officers have instant access.  Maneuvering and targeting commands can be quickly passed to a group of ships without the use of a flashing light or radio operator.  The short wavelength radio signals limit radio's range to the horizon.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6720;The use of skywaves allow the operator to communicate with vessels at longer ranges.  Skywaves are radio waves 'bounced' off ionized layers in the atmosphere.  The use of skywaves allows the radio mast to be made shorter.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6719;Sonar/ASDIC works by sending sound waves into the water where they are reflected off the target.  By timing the reflected sound wave the distance to the target is found.  Basic sonar/ASDIC cannot detect a submarine running on the surface because of reflections from the water's surface.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6718;This is a simple surface search radar.  The operator watches a line on the radar screen.  When a target is detected, a 'blip' appears along the line corresponding to the range.  A separate gauge tells the operator the bearing of the target.  The long wavelength that these radar sets use makes them vulnerable to clutter from nearby land.  This means that targets can be lost or not seen in confined waters.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6717;Radar was originally developed for use by stations on shore.  Before the radar sets could be used on ships they need to be 'hardened' to withstand the stress of being on a moving vessel.  The radar antennas need to be sealed to protect them from the corrosion associated with salt water.  These radar sets are so large that they must be mounted on a large vessel such as a cruiser, battleship, or carrier.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6716;As the field of electronics grew during the 1930s, production of cheap vacuum tubes made the development of devices like radar and small radio sets possible.  These improved electronic systems improve the ability of warships to survive combat and destroy enemy vessels.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6700;As navies made attacks against enemy held beaches, they have discovered that specialized equipment is necessary to make those attacks successful.  Specialized equipment protects the troops as they come ashore from enemy fire.  The specialized equipment is also designed to be manufactured quickly. ;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6624;The development of a nuclear power plant for naval vessels allows a new generation of long range designs to be developed.  These ships are redesigned super battleships with nuclear reactors replacing the boilers.  The internal arrangement has to be altered to create room for the reactors.  The secondary battery magazines are shifted toward the ends of the ship.  The removal of the stacks allows anti-aircraft batteries to have improved fields of fire.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6623;The development of the nuclear power plant allows new long range designs.  These are modified super carriers which replace the boilers with nuclear reactors.  These ships are considered to be the ultimate in naval power.  Over 300m (1000 ft) in length and having the ability to steam non-stop around the world makes these carriers the focal point of carrier taskforces.  Historically, this was the US Enterprise-class and Nimitz-class nuclear powered carriers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6622;These are large, multi-role carriers.  They are designed to operate jet fighters, heavy strike aircraft, and anti-submarine aircraft.  The increased size of these ships allows large air groups to be effectively used.  An armored flight deck gives these carriers the ability to survive bomb and missile hits.  Historically, this was the US Forrestal-class and French Foch-class carriers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6621;The increased speed and range of submarines means that they have to intercepted before they can approach a fleet or convoy.  To provide long range protection, specialized carriers carry anti-submarine aircraft and Sonar systems.  These carriers serve as flagships for specialized anti-submarine taskforces and escort groups.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6620;The development of nuclear power plants for naval vessels allows the development of new long range designs.  These ships are guided missile battleships modified to replace the boilers with nuclear reactors.  There are two long range surface-to-air missile launchers in place of the aft turrets.  The forward 406mm (16 inch) turrets are retained as anti-surface weapons and for use during shore bombardment.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6619;This is a battleship optimized for anti-aircraft protection of taskforces.  A pair of long range surface-to-air missile launchers are mounted aft in place of the aft turrets.  The 406mm (16 inch) guns are retained forward to provide shore bombardment and anti-surface weapons.  These ships are based on the post-treaty battleship design.  The reduction in fire control equipment for the main battery guns allows the superstructure to be consolidated.  This gives anti-aircraft guns and missiles improved fields of fire.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6618;The Washington Naval Treaty limits battleships to a standard displacement of 35,000 tons.  This isn't much larger than battleships completed at the end of World War I, but is much smaller than the designs that were being built or on the drawing board following the war.  This means that designers have to find a way to balance the new requirement for speed with the need for heavy armament and protection.  Historically, this was the British King George V-class and US North Carolina-class battleships.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6617;The success of the pocket battleship opened up new avenues of design based on ships with a smaller caliber main battery guns.  Although the pocket battleship was able to outfight cruisers limited by the Washington Treaty, they are liable to be chased down by battlecruisers or new fast battleships.  The larger design replaces the diesel engines of the pocket battleship with high pressure small tube boilers and geared turbines.  The larger hull also allows the number of heavy guns to be increased.  Historically, this was the French Dunkerque-class and German Scharnhorst-class battlecruisers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6616;The Germans were limited by the Versailles Treaty to battleships of 10,000 tons.  To remain within the limits of the treaty, a cruiser (small battleship) was designed that had more firepower than cruisers limited by the Washington Naval Treaty.  The weight of their armament limited the tonnage available for the engines.  To get long range for commerce raiding and reduce weight, a diesel plant was adopted.  This limited the speed of these cruisers to 28 knots.  This design was analyzed by other maritime power as an option, but was rejected as an inefficient use of valuable battleship tonnage.  Historically, this was the German Deutchland-class pocket battleships.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6615;The Washington Naval Treaty created the class of heavy cruiser (as opposed to light cruiser).  Heavy cruisers are cruisers with a main battery of 203mm (8 inch) guns.  The treaty limited cruisers to a standard displacement of 10,000 tons.  Heavy cruisers sacrifice armor protection for increased gun power.  These cruisers are sometimes known unaffectionately as 'Tin Clads.'  Historically, this was the US Northampton-class and British County-class heavy cruisers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6614;The Washington Naval Treaty created the class of light cruiser (as opposed to heavy cruiser).  Light cruisers are cruisers with a main battery of 152mm (6 inch) guns or smaller guns.  The treaty limited the size of all cruisers to 10,000 tons standard displacement.  The use of turrets for the main battery reduces the length of the vessel and provides additional room for engine rooms by eliminating magazines.  Historically, this was the British Leander-class and Italian Da Barbiano-class light cruisers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6613;The development of large destroyers filled two roles within the fleet.  These destroyers use their larger size to provide space for the staff necessary to command destroyer squadrons.  The large destroyers are also more survivable in combat.  The construction of large destroyers was limited by the Washington Treaty.  These large destroyers use almost twice the tonnage of the standard 1500 ton destroyers without twice the capability.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6612;This type of destroyer is representative of the first classes of interwar destroyers.  These destroyers take into account lessons that were learned during the first world war.  Advances in engineering, weaponry, construction techniques that were developed following the war increase the survivability of these destroyers.  Historically, this was the French Bourrasque-class and US Farragut-class destroyers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6611;The introduction of a standardized medium cargo vessel design allowed the production of modified vessels equipped with diesel engines.  The use of diesel engines allowed the vessel to use less fuel and run with a smaller engineering crew.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6610;As trade routes are centralized, the need for numerous, small cargo vessels is reduced.  These larger ships are designed to carry large volumes of cargo between a limited number of ports.  Typically, these ships have an amidships house and six or seven cargo holds at the ends of the vessel.  Historically, this was the US Maritime Commission C-2 cargo ships.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6600;The relaxation of the limitations of the Washington Naval Treaty opens up new areas of shipbuilding technology.  The use of marine electronics become more common as radar systems and small radios become available.  There are also improvements in naval aviation as fleets gain experience operating large groups of aircraft.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6536;These are small cruisers which are built in countries which need a large seagoing cruiser, but do not have the need for a large fleet cruiser.  These cruisers have main batteries of 152mm (6 inch), but have fewer guns than larger light cruisers.  They typically have 6 to 8 guns.  Historically, this was the British Leander-class and Dutch Tromp-class light cruisers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6535;The Washington Naval Treaty created a class of warships called sloops.  These ships were intended to be flagships and patrol vessels in colonies of the major powers.  By treaty, these new ships were limited to 2000 standard tons and guns no larger than 152mm (6 inches).  Historically, this was the US Eire-class and British Bridgewater-class sloops.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6534;Due to their high speed and greater range of view, airships appear to offer a cost-effective way to perform naval reconnaissance in place of cruisers.  This is of special importance to the United States, which possesses two vast naval frontiers on the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.  Implementing this involves intensive training with the fleet and the development of mobile mooring facilities.  These mobile facilities are mounted on specially modified surface ships so the airships can operate closely with the fleet.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6533;Aircraft launched from the ship spot the fall of shells that are beyond visual range.  An observer in the aircraft is able to provide accurate spotting information because of his location high above the battle area.  The observer radios corrections back to the vessel after each salvo.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6532;The basic secondary battery director is a result of the refinements in director technology.  As the technology gets better, it also becomes smaller.  This allows separate directors to be mounted to control the secondary battery guns.  Typically, there are two or more directors depending on the number of guns in the secondary battery.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6531;As fire control technology gets better, the ability to engage targets at long range improves as well.  Most directors are fitted with a long base rangefinder as an integral part of the director which allows quicker fire solutions.  These improved directors control all of the aiming and firing of guns within the turret.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6530;Advances in director technology is driven in part by better optics.  These optics allow precise targeting at longer ranges.  These optics are also installed in the turret to serve as a back-up system in the event that the director is put out of action.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6529;The increasing range which modern guns can fire at makes centralized fire control more important.  Increased range makes the danger area where the shell will hit smaller than at short range.  Small errors in the timing of firing the guns or the range prediction can result in the shells missing the target.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6528;The change from air to oxygen for powering the torpedo frees up space within the torpedo for a larger warhead.  The larger size of the warhead is combined with improved explosives to increase the hitting power of new torpedoes.  These new warhead designs can also be used in the torpedoes used by torpedo planes.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6527;Improvements in engine design allow the torpedo to create thrust more efficiently.  The fuel and oxygen are burned to provide an exhaust which is run through a turbine.  The turbine is connected to the propeller at the rear of the torpedo.  Ways have to be found to counter the gyroscopic force which is generated by the spinning turbine.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6526;Basic torpedoes work on a kerosene powered engine with standard air.  The kerosene is burned with the air to provide the energy to propel the torpedo through the water.  The replacement of the air with pure oxygen will make more space within the torpedo for more fuel or a larger warhead.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6524;The increased speeds and operating depths of enemy submarines force the development of better weapons to combat them.  Depth charge throwers enable the destroyer to lay larger patterns of depth charges.  The improved hydrodynamic shape of new depth charges allows them to sink faster.  This allows submarines to be effectively attacked at deeper depths.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6523;The use of dual speed torpedoes allows more flexibility in their use.  Dual speeds give the captain the choice of a long range shot with a slower speed, or a faster, short range shot.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6522;In previous designs, separate anti-surface and anti-aircraft guns were necessary.  With the limitations dictated by the Washington Naval Treaty, more efficient methods of mounting the guns had to be developed.  Ideal anti-surface weapons need a high muzzle velocity and a heavy shell.  Ideal anti-aircraft weapons have a quick rate of fire and train.  The dual purpose gun combines some of the characteristics of each type, but makes some sacrifices compared with each type.  This saves weight by allowing a single gun to replace two separate weapons.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6521;New weapons systems are more functional than previous designs.  These weapons systems are more useful in a variety of situations.  They allow weight saving though the replacement of multiple weapons mounts with a single mount.  This allows designers to increase the firepower on treaty limited designs.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6520;Diesel engines are traditionally used in vessels where speed doesn't matter, like merchant vessels.  The use of diesels in heavy warships will give benefits in range and reduced manpower.  The new high speed diesel engines combine the reliability of a diesel engine with the horsepower of a steam plant and turbine.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6519;Using models in tanks, it was discovered that a flat stern (transom stern) has the same hydrodynamic properties as a traditional curved stern.  The reduction in length saves weight through the removal of the complex framing associated with the traditional curved stern.  The weight saved can be used for increased armor protection or engine power.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6518;Aluminum is lighter than steel, but doesn't resist damage as well.  The use of aluminum for structures that don't have to resist damage saves weight for armor or weapons.  Special joints have to be made where aluminum and steel structures come together.  Typically, aluminum is used for superstructures or lightweight shields for guns.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6517;A small tube boiler allows a boiler to produce the same amount of steam in a smaller space.  The steam generation tubes are placed closer together and are shorter because of their smaller size.  Smaller generating tubes also allow higher operating pressures to be developed.  The combination of smaller volume and higher operating pressures allow smaller engineering spaces to be used which saves weight.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6516;Sloped armor saves weight because of the virtual increase in armor thickness gained when the armor is angled.  By angling the armor away from vertical, the cross section of the armor is thicker.  This allows protection to be increased without an increase in armor weight.  The problem with the internal belt armor is access.  If the armor is damaged, it is more difficult to repair because of its location.  The sloped belt also takes up more internal space than traditional belt armor.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6515;The concentration of the secondary guns into turrets allows a simplified arrangement.  In earlier designs, the secondary guns were distributed along the length of the hull in single gun casemates.  This prevented damage from taking out the entire secondary battery, but made ammunition distribution more difficult.  The use of turrets saves weight by concentrating the magazines and ammunition supply equipment to limited areas of the vessel.  Turrets also limit the area of the vessel that has to be protected with armor.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6514;The Washington Naval Limitation Treaty put limits on the size of most warships.  This treaty took effect with all warships that were built after 1922.  The treaty forces naval architects and marine engineers to develop technologies that allow new warships to be more powerful than their predecessors, but follow the weight restrictions of the treaty.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6500;The Washington Naval Treaty was signed in 1922.  As part of that treaty, nations agree to limits in displacement and weapon size.  The treaty also ended the naval building race that started shortly after the end of World War I.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6416;Although hydraulic catapults are more efficient, their use was limited on surface warships.  The problem with the hydraulic catapult is that it requires openings in the deck for the hydraulic lines.  This is difficult if the catapult is going to be mounted on top of an armored turret or deck.  The black powder catapult doesn't require any openings and the powder charges are kept in the ships magazine.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6415;Experimentation with the various conversions gives valuable experience in carrier operations.  This experience allows nations to determine which features will be best in purpose built carriers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6414;Many nations had fast battleships or battlecruisers that were surplus after the signing of the Washington Naval Treaty.  These hulls are perfect for conversion into large aircraft carriers.  The mountings for the turrets are removed and the hull built up to support the flight deck.  Historically, this was the US Lexington-class and Japanese Akagi-class carriers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6413;These are heavy wire ropes run across the carrier's deck.  The landing aircraft has a hook mounted on the tail which snags the rope bringing the aircraft to a stop.  The arrestor wire is connected to a series of hydraulic rams which absorb the energy of the landing aircraft.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6412;A catapult is used to launch the aircraft that is too heavy or when there is insufficient wind to provide lift.  The catapult works by harnessing the energy in a compressed fluid.  Hydraulic fluid is compressed in a reservoir where it can be released into the catapult.  The high pressure fluid pushes the shuttle down the track accelerating the aircraft to flight speed.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6411;The first carriers are naval auxiliaries or battleships converted with simple flight decks and aircraft handling facilities.  These conversions are mainly used for experimentation and the refining of the technology.  These simple carriers also have a limited role in combat.  Historically, this was the US Langley-class or French BÈarn-class carriers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6400;In the years following the first world war, naval technology kept growing due to a renewed naval building race.  This building race was stopped with the signing of the Washington Naval Limitation Treaty.  This forced nations to develop technologies that were more powerful, but still met displacement restrictions.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6312;The construction of rigid, lighter than air craft allows them to go farther, and to carry a larger payload than contemporary aircraft.  The first lighter than air craft are simple silk bags filled with hot air.  This new design is a rigid steel frame supporting individual cells filled with lightweight hydrogen gas.  The increased lifting power of the hydrogen gives the new craft a great increases in capability.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6311;The use of seaplanes for scouting and attacks was pioneered during World War I.  The first combat use of seaplanes was by the British Royal Navy during a bombing raid on German Zeppelin sheds.  Experience with seaplanes leads to developments in both the aircraft the effective use of them at sea.  Methods are developed to launch seaplanes while underway.  The use of platforms mounted on the bow generated wind to provide additional lift for the aircraft.  This pioneered the technology later used by aircraft carriers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6310;Early in the first world war, it was discovered that effective means were needed to combat submarines.  Effective weapons and tactics needed to be developed.  Depth charges and basic tactics are effective in combating submarines which can only submerge for short periods of time.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6309;Submarines are difficult targets to attack.  First they have to be found, and then an attack has to be made.  One of the first pieces of equipment developed was a simple system of hydrophones.  These are simple waterproof microphones that hear the sounds generated by the submarine's propeller.  This allows the submarine to be tracked while submerged.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6308;Interlocking gears are used to transfer the power from the turbine to the propeller shaft.  These gears use a herringbone pattern to prevent energy loss from slipping.  The use of a gear system allows a high pressure and a low pressure turbine to be used to drive a single propeller.  This makes the use of steam more efficient.  The use of the gears also allows the turbines to turn at their most efficient speed without causing cavitation with the propellers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6307;Forcing air into the boiler allows more efficient combustion of the fuel.  Air is used to both atomize (spray) the fuel into the boiler and provide extra air for combustion.  Large fans are mounted in the upper levels of the engine room which compress the air and force it into the boiler.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6300;Experience during the first world war showed that the operation of aircraft off ships at sea is possible.  The use of aircraft in attacks on targets ashore during the war showed that aircraft could fill roles that surface ships traditionally filled.  Maritime nations can develop specialized vessels for deploying aircraft at sea.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6213;Even after the Battle of Jutland, the value of the battlecruiser in fleet actions remained.  To remedy the faults of previous battlecruisers, more armor was added to protect the magazines from plunging fire at long ranges.  Flash protection in the turrets was improved to prevent damage to the turret from spreading to the magazines.  This results in ships that are virtually fast battleships.  Historically, this was the British battlecruiser Hood.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6212;The concept of the fast battleship was developed to give navies the option of choosing the time and the place of engagement.  These ships were historically limited to specialized squadrons designed to operate independently from the rest of the battlefleet.  These ships are typically armed with eight 356mm guns or similar caliber weapons.  Historically, this was the British Queen Elizabeth-class and Japanese Nagato-class fast battleships.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6211;The development of more powerful naval guns makes these battleships more formidable than previous classes of battleships.  In addition to larger guns, these new ships also have thicker armor belts and more powerful engines.  The danger of long range gunfire requires thick deck armor which also resists bombs dropped by aircraft.  They main battery of these ships is typically eight to twelve 356mm guns or similar caliber weapons.  Historically, this was the German Bayern-class and US Colorado-class battleships.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6210;The battlecruiser is designed to fight through the enemy cruisers and serve as a scout for the battleships.  Because of their heavy guns, battlecruisers became part of the battlefleet themselves.  They are typically armed with eight heavy caliber guns of equal size to dreadnaughts, but lack the armor protection.  Historically, this was the Japanese Kongo-class and Turkish Yavuz-class battlecruisers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6209;This battleship is an improvement of the pre-dreadnaught type.  By replacing the multiple medium caliber weapons with large caliber weapons, they increased the hitting power.  They are typically armed with eight to twelve 305mm guns for attacking enemy ships at long range.  They are also armed with some small caliber weapons for defense against smaller warships and aircraft.  Historically, this was the French Corbet-class and Spanish EspaÒa-class battleships.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6208;This is a small battleship armed with two main gun turrets, numerous medium caliber secondary guns, and smaller weapons as a tertiary battery.  They are slow with heavy armor.  These battleships aren't able to fight a modern battleship one on one, but they are more than a match for cruiser if they close the range.  Historically, this was the Swedish Sverige-class or Greek Kilikis-class battleships.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6207;These are small battleships which are suitable for use in coastal waters.  They are armed with two or four 254mm guns, or a similar caliber weapons, with numerous secondary and tertiary weapons.  They have lighter armor than full sized battleships, but still have heavier armor than cruisers.  For their size, these ships are heavily armed.  Historically, this was the Norwegian Norge-class and Danish Peter Iuels-class coast defense battleships.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6200;The first world war provided a wealth of experience in fleet operations.  Fleet commanders learned how to use and maneuver large groups of warships.  Admiralty Boards learned how to use advantages of wireless communications with distant fleets.  The use of convoys to combat attacks by submarines was another valuable lesson that was learned.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6123;For decades, the fastest ship to cross the Atlantic Ocean has been the holder of the fabled 'Blue Ribband.'  The ship that holds the Blue Ribband at any particular time has the distinction of being the fastest, and usually the most popular vessel making the crossing.  The design of these ships is much more complex than the design of other passenger liners.  They have larger, more elegant passenger spaces and the engine spaces are larger and more complex as well.  Historically, this was the British Queen Mary and the French Normandie.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6122;Anti-submarine operations in the North Atlantic require a vessel larger than a standard destroyer.  The escort sloop trades speed for a more stable hull and better endurance.  These sloops differ from their larger cousins by having more anti-submarine warfare capability and smaller guns.  Historically, this was the British Flower-class and Australian Grimsby-class sloops.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6121;The conversion of merchant vessels is a quick way to get serviceable warships.  Unfortunately, these converted warships still have the vulnerabilities common to all merchant ships.  They lack subdivision and redundancy of machinery that is typical of other warships their size.  They are armed with multiple medium or small caliber guns.  Historically, this was the German raiders Atlantis and Thor.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6120;These cruisers are slow and heavily armored and armed.  They are typically armed with a few large caliber guns and numerous smaller weapons.  Their slow speed prevents them from operating in a scouting role for modern fleets, but their heavy armament and armor makes them effective at protecting convoys from commerce raiders.  Historically, this was the Italian San Giorgio-class and Japanese Idzumo-class armored cruisers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6119;These ships are useful for scouting and serving as flagships for destroyer flotillas.  Armed with numerous small or medium caliber guns as a main armament, they are designed to rely on firepower and speed rather than armor protection.  Historically, this was the Japanese Sendai-class and German Emden-class light cruisers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6118;This is a small, lightly armed, and unarmored cruiser typically used for colony defense.  They are armed with numerous small guns (127mm) as the main battery.  Historically, this was the US Chester-class and German Gazelle-class cruisers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6117;These are small destroyer with minimal armament and protection.  Typically armed with three or four 105mm guns and eight torpedoes, these are the first effective fleet destroyers.  They are designed to counter enemy torpedo attacks and make torpedo attacks of their own.  These destroyers are typical of the mass produced designs from World War I.  Historically, this was the US Clemson-class and UK V-Class destroyers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6116;These are small destroyers with minimal armament and protection.  Typically armed with two or three 105mm guns and four torpedoes, these are basic destroyers.  They aren't well suited for combat with modern naval units, but they are sufficient for use by small nations.  Historically, this was the Brazilian Para-class destroyers or Danish Dragen-class torpedo boats.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6115;These large vessels are designed to carry passengers on voyages across the Atlantic or Pacific Oceans.  During times of war they are readily convertible into troop transports.  Liners are also used for conversion into auxiliary warships.  These ships' high speed comes from extremely large engines and long hulls.  Their large size and complicated engine plant mean that they are more difficult to build than standard merchant vessels.  Historically, this was the British liner Queen Mary or French liner Normandie.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6114;These small, general purpose vessels are cheap and easy to build.  Powered by a large marine diesel engine, it has a long range and a small engineering crew.  These vessels typically have an amidships house, and three or four cargo holds located at the ends of the vessel.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6113;These small, general purpose vessels are cheap and easy to build.  Powered by an efficient reciprocating engine that gives fairly good range and a small cargo carrying capacity, these vessels make up the bulk of national merchant marines.  The superstructure is typically located amidships, and there are three or four cargo holds located at the ends of the vessel.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6100;These are basic designs that can be built by most nations.  These transports, destroyers, cruisers, and battleships are mostly characterized by numerous small guns and slower speeds than later designs.  These designs are typical of warships built prior to, and during World War I.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6041;These are specialized troops trained to make assaults on enemy held beaches.  Because of the high level of training required to make these assaults, these troops are considered elite in many nations.  The use of marines date back to the days of sailing ships when they were used to defend warships against boarders and to provide anti-personnel fire.  More recently, marines have been used to protect national interests in foreign countries.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6040;Basic training allows regular infantry units to make attacks on enemy beaches.  The use of basic landing craft such as prams or barges allow troops to be landed on a hostile shore.  These improvised landing craft are unable to withstand enemy fire, so their ability to attack defended beaches is limited.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6039;The director is the key component of a centralized fire control system.  All of the range and bearing information is gathered in the director which calculates the fire control solution.  The targeting information is transmitted to the turret where the gunner puts the turret on target and fires the guns.  The gunner simply has to match the turret settings with the settings transmitted from the director to hit the target.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6038;Information from spotters located high in the vessel is passed to a central location.  This information allows more accurate correction of the range information which is transmitted to the individual gun turrets.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6037;These are basic optics that improve the ability to hit the target in conditions other than perfect visibility.  These optics provide minimal amounts of magnification and light amplification.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6036;Fire control is necessary to ensure that the weapons hit the target.  Basic technology is needed to start the process of moving the targeting of weapons from the individual gun pointer to more centralized locations.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6035;This is the initial development for surface torpedoes.  Torpedoes are warheads that are driven to their target with a motor.  They strike the target below the waterline allowing water to flood the target and sink her.  Experimentation is necessary to get the torpedo to run straight and at the correct depth.  These torpedoes are a relatively short ranged weapon with a small warhead.  Historically, this was the British Whitehead torpedo.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6034;The production of large marine diesel engines is useful because of their efficiency in the use of fuel.  A marine diesel engine runs on lower grades of diesel fuel than are needed by road vehicles because of the larger size of the pistons.  It takes a lot of development work to be able to build a diesel engine that has enough power to efficiently propel a vessel of any size.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6033;Steam from the boiler is injected into the turbine where it hits blades which are attached to a central hub.  The force of the steam hitting the blades causes the hub to turn.  The hub is attached directly to the propeller shaft.  This allows high speeds in a small engine.  Steam turbines aren't as efficient in fuel use because of the need to keep rotation speed small to avoid propeller cavitation.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6032;This is the first type of engine development and the most simple.  Steam from the boiler is injected into a series of cylinders where expansion of the steam pushes the pistons.  The pistons are connected to a rod which is attached to the propeller shaft.  Most engines of this type have three cylinders per propeller shaft.  These plants are efficient in fuel use, but are difficult to maintain because of the wear and tear from stopping the pistons and rods at the end of each stroke.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6031;A basic steam plant generates low pressure steam (50-100 psi) for use in providing power and propulsion for the vessel.  The steam is generated in a boiler and then run through a piston or turbine.  The steam is then run through a condenser and condensed back into water.  The condensed water is pumped back into the boiler to start the process again.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6030;Marine engineering is the study of how to get ships to move through the water.  The main concept is how to generate steam and use it to turn the propeller.  This is done many ways, but the two main ways are through pistons or turbines.  Basic engineering is also used to design basic weapons systems.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6029;Battleships are designed to fight any vessel, anywhere.  Battleships have heavy armor and guns designed to sink enemy vessels at long range.  In addition to their heavy main battery guns, they also have numerous smaller weapons as a secondary anti-ship and anti-aircraft battery.  They are also useful in supporting amphibious operations by firing at targets on shore.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6028;Cruisers are the workhorses of any fleet.  In times of peace, cruisers are useful for protecting national interests by 'showing the flag' in foreign ports.  In times of war, cruisers are useful in scouting and escort duties.  Cruisers have evolved from having smaller weapons spread in individual mounts around the vessel to having their guns concentrated into turrets.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6027;The design of destroyers has evolved from turn of the century torpedo boats.  As the torpedo boats became larger, the torpedo boat destroyer became large enough to operate with the fleet.  The destroyer eventually replaced the torpedo boat all together.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6026;Transport designs are fairly generic.  Transports are designed to maximize the internal volume for carrying cargo.  Merchant ships are also designed to be easily run by a small crew.  They typically have one, large engine room with the boilers and associated control equipment in a single space.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6025;The design of naval and merchant vessels is a technical process.  The design has to have a balance between the amount of weight used for weapons, armor, and propulsion.  The ability of countries to make their own designs with outside help requires the training of skilled personnel.  These personnel are trained to make the detailed plans that are required for building complex designs.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6024;These vessels are necessary for replenishing the fuel used by vessels while they are underway.  This fuel is typically transferred while the vessel is tied to a pier.  Following the development of underway replenishment doctrines, the transfer of fuel can occur while the ships are at sea.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6023;These vessels are necessary for replenishing the ammunition of warships following battle or target practice while away from base.  This transfer of ammunition typically happens while the ship is tied up to a pier. Following the development of underway replenishment doctrines, these transfers can occur while the ships are at sea.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6022;These vessels are necessary to get supplies from naval bases to the vessels that require them.  These supplies include everything from food to spare parts and replacement personnel.  These are typically merchant vessels that have been acquired for use by the navy.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6021;This is the infrastructure required to maintain the fleet in operational status.  This includes long range communications, naval strategy boards, naval training schools and other support activities.  Bases have to be established to provide locations to repair and replenish ships.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6020;This is the infrastructure needed to procure supplies for supporting naval operations outside of coastal waters.  Logistical support is provided by a central organization which ensures commonality throughout the fleet.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6019;This is heavy armor that is used as the main belt armor of battleships and battlecruisers.  The armor is face hardened through use of metals other than steel and special processes.  This gives the armor the ability to break up enemy shells on the face of the armor, but still retain enough flexibility to not shatter.  A softer backing material provides the flexibility.  Historically, this was the Harvey and Krupps face hardening processes.  This armor is also known as 'Class A' armor.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6018;This is light armor that is the main belt armor for cruisers and other small warships.  This armor is also used as the superstructure armor on heavy warships like battleships.  The armor is homogenous meaning that the armor properties are uniform through the thickness of the armor.  This armor is also known as 'Class B' armor.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6017;The construction of large bore, heavy naval rifles make the construction of battleships truly possible.  These large naval rifles fire two or three shells per minute and are loaded with machinery within the turret.  The shell is loaded separately from the powder which is contained in several bags.  The bags of powder are loaded after the shell is in place.  These guns serve as the main battery for battleships, battlecruisers, and armored cruisers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6016;The construction of medium bore, rapid firing naval rifles requires different skills than are used for manufacturing smaller weapons.  These weapons typically have a separate shell and cartridge to keep the total weight down.  The shell is still light enough to be loaded by a single person.  These weapons serve as the main battery for cruisers and also as secondary battery weapons on battleships.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6015;The construction of small bore, rapid fire naval rifles is necessary for the construction of any warship.  These guns serve as the main battery for small warships and as the secondary or tertiary batteries, of large warships.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6014;The construction of naval vessels takes very specialized equipment.  The slipways needed to build the hulls of large naval vessels have to be able to support the additional weight of armor.   The redundant engineering systems also add weight to the hull.  There have to be facilities for the installation and testing of the combat systems.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6013;The construction of merchant vessels is more simple than the construction of naval vessels.  This is due to the large spaces within the vessel and a more simplified layout. Because of the reduced crew complement, the superstructure is also simplified compared to a warship.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_6000;These are the basic industries that are needed by a country before the buildup of naval forces.  This includes the construction on infrastructure and ship design capabilities.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5971;When nuclear fission was first discovered, the navy was quick to see the potential as a propulsion system that wouldn't require air.  The reactor is used to heat water.  The superheated water is sent into a steam generator where the radioactive water is used to make non-radioactive steam.  The steam runs a conventional steam turbine to provide propulsion.  The water is pumped back into the reactor as coolant and the cycle restarts.  These are the first submarines built since before World War I that use a steam turbine for propulsion.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5941;Improvements in Air Independent Propulsion systems allow better designs to be developed.  The heart of these new designs are better engines, but there are also improvements in the auxiliary systems which have been developed from war experience. ;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5916;The development of the nuclear reactor means that a submarine can be built that is totally independent from outside air for propulsion.  The power plant consists of a water cooled nuclear reactor that is used to generate steam which is used for driving a standard steam turbine.  The nuclear reactor doesn't need air which means that the submarine is only limited by the endurance of the crew.  The only limitation to the submarine's range is the amount of food that can be carried onboard.  Historically, this was the US Nautilus-class and Soviet November-class nuclear submarines.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5915;Improvements in the Walter turbine enabled the submarines equipped with the turbine to be more effective.  Hydrogen-peroxide is broken into hydrogen and oxygen then combined with diesel to create steam which is run through the turbine.  This allows the submarine to make short bursts of submerged speed while attacking enemy convoys and taskforces.  This allows them to evade counterattacks more effectively.  These submarines have less range than a standard long range submarine because of the hull space that is taken up by the hydrogen-peroxide tanks means that less diesel fuel is carried.;;;;;;;;;;X

CTECD_5912;Improvements in the closed-cycle process enabled improvements to be made in the original closed-cycle  designs.  Liquefied oxygen is carried onboard the submarine to provide air for the diesel engines while running submerged.  This oxygen is mixed with an inert gas like argon which is recycled to save space.  It also makes the combustion process more efficient.  These submarines are larger than standard long range submarines in order to provide space for the cylinders of oxygen.  Unfortunately, there is still less room for fuel within the hull giving them a shorter range than standard long range submarines.;;;;;;;;;;X

CTECD_5909;The improvements in submarine technology have been aimed towards developing this generation of submarines.  This class of submarines includes all of the improvements that have been developed in pressure hulls, diesel engines, sensors and batteries.  These submarines are more capable than previous generations of long range submarines.  They are able to dive deeper and stay submerged longer than their predecessors.  This makes them very capable while attacking enemy convoys or taskforces.  Historically, this was the US Guppy modified Gato-class and Soviet Foxtrot-class submarines.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5908;All of the improvements in submarine technology have been leading up to this generation of submarines.  This submarine includes all of the improvements that have been developed in pressure hulls, diesel engines, sensors, and batteries.  These submarines are able to dive deeper and stay submerged than their predecessors.  This makes them very capable while attacking convoys or enemy taskforces.  Historically, this was the German Type XXI-class U-Boats.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5907;All of the improvements in submarine technology have been leading towards this design.  This submarine combines all of the improvements in pressure hull, sensors, battery and diesel engine technologies.  These submarines are able to dive deeper and stay submerged longer than their predecessors.  This makes them very effective in attacking convoys or taskforces.  Historically, this was the Japanese Sen(suikan) taka sho-class submarines and German Type XXV-class U-Boats.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5906;The use of the nuclear reactor to power a submarine will increase the ability of the submarine to operate.  With the development of aircraft and increased sensor ability, it is dangerous for submarines to operate on the surface.  Even technologies like the Walter Turbine and the Closed-cycle engine need to put a snorkel above the water to get the most out of those systems.  The nuclear reactor will allow the submarine to remain submerged almost indefinitely because of its complete independence from air.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5905;Improvements to the Walter Turbine allowed the engine to become more efficient.  The turbine works by breaking hydrogen-peroxide into its base components of hydrogen and oxygen which are very hot.  The oxygen is mixed with diesel fuel and ignited by the temperature of the oxygen.  The gas and hydrogen are run through the turbine in the same manner as a conventional steam turbine.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5904;Improvements to the concept of the closed-cycle engine allowed it to become more efficient.  It was observed that combining the oxygen with an inert gas like argon would improve the efficiency of the engine.  The argon is injected with the oxygen into the cylinder of the engine and then collected as exhaust on the other end of the reaction.  The collected argon is recycled so the amount of argon carried onboard is minimal.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5900;These designs are the culmination of years of submarine development which stretch back to the late 1800s.  These submarines use technology which was undreamed of just years before.  They are a combination of lessons learned through combat and the evolution of submarine and naval design.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5815;The use of the Walter Turbine gives the submarine the ability to make short sprints at high speeds to avoid enemy counterattacks.  Hydrogen-peroxide is broken down and combined with diesel to provide steam for the turbine.  The steam is highly corrosive and explosive so the system is hazardous to use.  The submarine is larger than a standard long range submarine to make room for the large hydrogen-peroxide tanks, but there is still less room for diesel fuel.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5814;The use of the liquid oxygen to provide air for the diesel allows the batteries to be recharged while the submarine is operating submerged.  This system works to supplement the snorkel when the boat is unable to raise the mast due to enemy attacks.  This increases the distance and speed that the submarine can use for evading attacking enemy forces.  By increasing both the distance and the speed, the area that the enemy forces have to search is increased exponentially.  This will result in the submarine surviving the encounter more frequently.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5813;The use of nuclear power for submarines gives them large advantages over any conventionally powered submarine.  The main advantage is the ability to remain submerged without having to worry about providing air for diesel engines or fuel for alternative engines.  This will give the submarine nearly limitless range.  This will be a long process of design and experimentation.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5812;The problem with torpedoes is that once they were fired no changes could be made.  With the inclusion of a control wire into the torpedo will allow simple commands to be sent to the torpedo and information to be sent from the torpedo back to the submarine.  A lightweight, extremely thin wire is connected to the submarine and spooled out as the torpedo runs toward the target.  This set-up allows the torpedo to run maneuvers which will help keep the location of the firing submarine more in doubt.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5811;With submarines operating underwater for longer periods of time, the need for a method of underwater navigation became apparent.  The internal navigation system uses sensors to record the path that the submarine has taken since submerging.  Three sensors measure the submarine's movement in the six axis of motion.  This information allows the navigator to determine the position of the submarine to a certain degree.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5810;Advances in hydrophones combined with advances in active sonar systems resulted in combined systems that are better than the individual parts.  These sonar systems are able to accurately track submerged targets and targets on the surface.  The hydrophones are able to accurately measure the bearing of the sound as well as signal strength which allows passive sonar tracking of targets.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5809;Improvements in optics meant that new periscopes were more precise than their predecessors.  Ranging with the periscope was done with a stadimeter which compared two images.  The waterline of the upper image was 'brought down' to the masthead of the lower image.  Using the height of the mast the range can be determined.  The accuracy of the optics will affect the accuracy of the range prediction.  These improved periscope optics allow for more accurate range estimations and better performance in low light situations.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5808;Improvements in power generation also meant that there were improvements in the equipment that is used for charging the batteries on submarines.  These chargers are able to charge the batteries more quickly than their predecessors.  The use of a trickle charger which adds a small amount of current to the batteries continuously keeps the batteries charged to full capacity.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5807;Improvements in the storage batteries allowed for more efficient storage of energy for use by the electric motors which drive the submarine while submerged.  These batteries are sealed units which don't require maintenance by the crew to keep them operating.  This makes them more safe to operate and less prone to damage than their predecessors.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5806;These are lightweight, powerful engines.  The extensive use of aluminum in the construction of the engine means that the weight is saved for other systems on the submarine.  These engines are also more powerful than their predecessors.  These diesel engines are also easier to maintain through more simple construction.  The cast aluminum parts are easy to manufacture which means that engine production can be dispersed into different manufacturing locations.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5805;Improvements in the design of pressure hulls meant that the newest generation of the submarine would be able to dive deeper.  These new pressure hulls had to be more hydrodynamic to support the higher speeds that are required by operations.  These pressure hulls are also more resistant to damage through more advanced metals and better welds.  These pressure hulls also have fewer penetrations which would weaken the hull.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5800;The improvements in submarine building technology would provide the technology that would lead the submarine into the post-war period.  This technology was developed in response to the improvements in anti-submarine technology that was making life difficult for the submarine.  Most of these technologies were designed to give the submarine increased ability to attack and move while submerged.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5718;The Walter Turbine Engine allowed a submarine to make short bursts of speed while submerged.  The Walter Turbine converted hydrogen peroxide into steam which powered the turbine when combined with diesel fuel.  The turbine required large volumes of hydrogen peroxide to operate which meant that the submarine used a lot of the volume available for the storage of fuel.  This meant that the submarine is larger than other medium range submarines.  The volume used for the hydrogen peroxide means that the range is reduced compared to other medium range submarines.  Historically, this is the German Type XXVII class U-Boats.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5717;The Walter Turbine allowed a submarine to make short bursts of submerged speed.  The Walter Turbine converted hydrogen peroxide into steam which powered the turbine when combined with diesel fuel.  The turbine required large volumes of fuel to operate which meant that the submarine used a lot of the volume available for the storage of fuel.  This meant that less volume was available for diesel which gave these submarines less range.  Historically, this was the German Type XXII-class U-Boats.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5716;The development of the closed-cycle engine meant that submarines could be developed that could use their engines for a short period of time while operating submerged.  This is accomplished through using liquefied oxygen contained in tanks to supply air to the diesel engine while submerged.  These submarines are larger than other medium ranged submarines due to the requirement of fitting large tanks to carry the liquefied oxygen.  Historically, this was a number of prototypes developed by Germany and utilized by the other nations following the armistice.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5715;The development of the closed-cycle engine meant that submarines could be developed that could use their engines for a short period of time while operating submerged.  This is accomplished through using liquefied oxygen contained in tanks to supply air to the diesel engine while submerged.  The space taken up by the oxygen tanks means that the torpedo complement is limited.  Historically this was the Soviet Project 618 prototype submarine.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5714;Improvements in the equipment available for constructing submarines were incorporated into the designs for long range submarines.  These submarines are able to use their improved designs to make more effective attacks on enemy convoys and taskforces.  Historically, this was the US Tench-class and British U-class submarines.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5713;The acoustic homing torpedo uses the noise generated by the target's propeller to home on the target.  The torpedo has four hydrophones spaced around the body of the torpedo.  The torpedo is designed to turn the torpedo towards the loudest sound source.  The torpedo can search in both the horizontal and vertical planes.  The space in the torpedo that is needed for the hydrophones means that these torpedoes have a smaller warhead than other torpedoes, but it is usually sufficient to disable an attacking escort rather than necessarily sink it.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5712;Improvements in radar technology allowed the radar antenna to be made smaller.  This allowed the antenna to be mounted on more submarines.  The improvements also allowed the radar to be used while the submarine was operating submerged.  A waveguide is placed into the periscope tube which will allow for more accurate ranging of targets.  This makes the periscope head slightly larger, but the advantage of being able to use the radar while submerged is a significant improvement.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5711;The Walter Engine is a revolutionary concept for providing propulsive power while operating submerged.  The Walter Turbine Engine uses nearly pure hydrogen-peroxide and breaks it down into its base components of hydrogen and oxygen.  This mixture was hot enough to generate steam.  Diesel fuel was injected into the hot mixture which increased the temperature and pressure of the steam.  This steam was injected into specially built turbines to provide propulsion.  This turbine propulsion allows the submarine to be maneuvered at high submerged speeds.  The drawbacks to this system were the highly corrosive effects of the fuel itself and the high volatility of the fuel which would explode if not handled correctly.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5710;The concept of the closed cycle engine is to give the submarine a way to supply oxygen to the engines while running submerged.  This is accomplished by having compressed oxygen in cylinders supply oxygen for the engines.  This allows the engines to be run when the submarine is unable to use the snorkel or surface.  Unfortunately, this is a capability that has to be built into the submarine and can't be retrofitted into existing hulls.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5709;The development of the snorkel didn't just include the development of the hardware itself, but also included the development of the tactics necessary to utilize the new system in combat.  The use of the snorkel would enable the submarine to recharge their batteries while operating submerged.  This will allow the submarine to avoid one of the most vulnerable periods in their operations: operating on the surface while recharging their batteries.  The snorkel is fitted to a retractable mast on the conning tower of the submarine and is fitted with a valve that will prevent water from entering the submarine while submerged.;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5708;As submerged attacks became more of a necessity, it became apparent that the deck gun was becoming obsolete.  The development of radar meant that submarines were no longer able to make night attacks on the surface.  The removal of the deck gun would have the added benefit of increasing the submerged speed of the submarine because of the reduced drag from removing the deck gun.  This also made the submarine quieter by removing a source of noise from the water swirling around the parts of the gun.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5700;As the war continued, more operational experience was gained.  At the beginning of the war, submarines had been able to make attacks with little to worry from counterattacking destroyers and aircraft.  As anti-submarine experience improved, submarine losses started to increase at frightening rates.  Measures had to be developed to enable the submarine to remain effective in this more deadly environment.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5614;The improvements in the technology available for constructing submarines resulted in submarines that were superior to their predecessors in both attack and defense.  The medium range submarine was designed to be mass produced and be used to cut the lines of communications of the enemy.  These submarines are more capable of penetrating the anti-submarine screens of enemy convoys and then evade counterattacks.  Historically, this was the German Type VII/42-class U-Boats.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5613;The improvements in the technology available for constructing submarines resulted in a new generation of submarines.  The smaller, short range submarines were the first ones that benefited from the improved technology.  The small submarines were more able to penetrate the anti-submarine screens for enemy convoys and taskforces and evade counterattacks by enemy destroyers.  Historically, this was the German Type IID-class U-Boats.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5612;Improvements in electronics allowed for more precise hydrophones to be developed.  The improvement in the accuracy in the hydrophones would allow effective attacks to be made without having to visually track the target through the periscope.  This meant that an attack could be made without having to expose the submarine on the surface.  More accurate hydrophones also allowed the submarine to make more efficient evasion maneuvers because they could more accurately track the attacking destroyers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5611;Although the concept behind the periscope is simple, it is possible to find way to improve the periscope.  The optics that make up part of the periscope are the first step in improving performance.  Better manufactured optics will make estimates of heights and bearings more accurate.  There are also improvements that can be made in the ability of the periscope to resist damage.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5610;The improvements that allowed small generators to be used to provide emergency power for damage control allowed the generators used for recharging the batteries to be made smaller.  These improvements included advances in the tightness of the windings within the commutator and the efficiency of the generator.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5609;Improvements in the batteries used in submarines would give them extra range while submerged.  The use of different metals than the traditional lead meant that the batteries would be more efficient during charging and discharging the energy.  These batteries are also more resistant to damage because they can be sealed.  Previous batteries tended to leak when exposed to extreme lists or trim.  By sealing the battery it would reduce the deadly chlorine gas that occurred when acid was mixed with seawater.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5608;The new diesel engine technology is mainly concerned with getting more horsepower out of a smaller package.  By developing smaller diesel engines it would free up valuable internal space for other equipment.  The improvements would also allow the fuel efficiency of the new engines to be improved.  This would allow the submarines to operate at longer ranges from their bases.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5607;With the development of propulsion systems that allowed the submarine to remain submerged for longer periods of time meant that underwater performance became more important than surfaced performance.  The idea was to eliminate sharp edges which reduce the underwater performance and also provide surfaces for air bubbles to develop which makes the submarine noisy while running submerged.  The flooding system also had to be redesigned to eliminate the large free flooding holes in the exterior of the hull.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5606;Improvements in design and construction of the pressure hull meant that the next generation of submarines would have better operational ability.  They would be able to dive deeper and be more resistant to damage.  Much of this additional strength comes from the ability to distribute the stress more evenly over the surface of the pressure hull through the use of welding the seams.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5600;As the war continued, naval architects were able to come up with design solutions that would allow the next generation of submarines to be more survivable.  These design improvements combined with new technologies would make these submarines the most technologically advanced that would be produced during the war.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5516;The improvements in the ability of aircraft to attack submarines meant that it could be easier for the submarine to stay on the surface and fight the aircraft.  This meant that the number and size of the anti-aircraft had to be improved.  Large platforms are constructed on the forward and after sides of the conning tower where the guns can have large fields of fire.  This modification slows down the submarine because of the added weight and drag of the platforms and the guns.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5515;When aircraft radar sets were converted from decimetric to centimetric wavelengths, the current radar detectors were unable to detect attacking aircraft.  This meant that a new detector had to be developed to enable the submarine to detect potential attackers before they are in range to attack.  These detectors are specially constructed to be quickly assembled and disassembled.  This allows them to be set-up and taken down while running on the surface and eliminate the need for extensive waterproofing.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5514;This is a small radar set which is attached to a mast on the submarine.  The radar allows the submarine to accurately get the range of a target and attack more accurately.  It also allows the submarine to detect targets at greater range than is possible with just lookouts alone.  These radar antennas are specially constructed to allow them to be immersed in salt water for long periods of time.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5513;With the increasing accuracy of sonar/ASDIC, it was realized that something had to be done to help submarines that had been detected.  A series of countermeasures were developed to create false targets on the enemy sonar.  These took a number of different shapes.  The most simple was a neutrally buoyant balloon which when released, would float underwater creating a target.  Another type was canister which would release bubbles which would reflect the sound waves creating a false target.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5512;The pattern running torpedo is very important for use against convoys.  Many attacks failed because the torpedo simply missed the target.  Even in a convoy where many targets are bunched together, the odds of hitting a ship on the far side of the target were remote.  A pattern running torpedo increased the odds by giving the torpedo more chances to hit a target in the tightly bunched convoys.  The pattern run could be selected by the captain depending on the configuration of the convoy.  The captain could choose from a ladder pattern which would advance either right or left along the course of the convoy in long legs, or a snake pattern which would weave back and forth along a course line.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5511;One of the most difficult jobs for submarines on patrol was finding targets to attack.  By coordinating with aircraft, the effective sighting range of the submarines was increased.  The aircraft would be launched to find convoys and other targets.  When a target was found, the position was radioed to a central control center which would pass on the information to the proper submarines;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5510;The use of submarines to scout enemy facilities and landing locations allowed for better intelligence to be gained.  Unfortunately, this meant that the submarine would be required to enter shallow waters that would make detection easier.  Once in the area where the observations were to be made, the submarine would take pictures through the periscope.  The benefit of the intelligence data was believed to outweigh the increased risk to the submarine.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5509;Submarines are remarkably suited to modular construction.  The cylinders which make up the submarine's pressure hull are fairly easy to manufacture and then stick on a railroad car for transportation to the shipyard.  This means that the resources of the shipyard can be focused on assembling the submarine and any technical work that has to be done for completion.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5508;Improvements in anti-submarine equipment and tactics meant that submarines were having to spend more time submerged.  This meant that methods had to be discovered that would allow the submarine to run submerged for longer periods of time in order to evade attacking escorts.  A Walter engine runs on Hydrogen Peroxide.  The oxygen is already contained in the fuel, so no external source of oxygen is necessary.  This means that the boat can run for extended periods of time submerged without needing air for the engines.  The difficulty with the Hydrogen Peroxide is the flammability of the fuel.  It is extremely flammable and poses an extreme explosion hazard.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5507;Improvements in anti-submarine equipment and tactics meant that submarines were having to spend more time submerged.  The limitations of batteries meant that the range and maneuverability of the submarine was more limited while the submarine was submerged.  The concept of the closed cycle engine is that compressed oxygen is stored onboard the submarine for use in powering the diesel engine while the submarine is submerged.  This is only done while the submarine can't use its snorkel or other air breathing device to conserve the supply of oxygen.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5506;The concept of the snorkel is simple.  Extend a pipe above the surface of the water to provide air for the diesels while the submarine is submerged.  Although the concept is simple, the execution of the idea is more complex.  The pipe that is extended above water has to have a reliable means for shutting to keep water out in the event that it goes beneath the surface.  The other problem is how to deploy the mast which contains the snorkel.  This meant that there needed to be a long period of testing and evaluation before the new tool could be used with operational units.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5500;AS the war progressed, experience continued to find better ways for submarines to operate and to be built.  Tactics and equipment that were good were updated and improved.  Pre-war ideas that were obsolete were discarded.  This made the submarine force more formidable.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5414;Improvements in the technology available for submarine construction allowed for improvements in the standard 'fleet boats' that made up the long range striking arms of most of the users of submarines.  These boats were more capable than their predecessors through increased ability to remain submerged, higher submerged speeds, and better detection equipment.  Historically, this was the US Gato-class, British T-class submarines and German Type-IX class U-Boats.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5413;Experience early in the war showed that there were reliability problems with torpedoes.  Testing prior to the war was carried out under ideal conditions.  War shots were made at less than ideal angles and conditions.  As submarines came back into port reports were filed stating that the torpedoes were faulty.  Initially, the reports were dismissed as commanders trying to cover the fact that they were missing the target.  Eventually, it was realized that there really was something wrong with the torpedoes.  Further testing narrowed down the problems and allowed remedies to be found.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5412;The increase in the number of attacks on submarines by aircraft was causing losses.  In order to counter these attacks, anti-aircraft guns had to be mounted.  These guns were different than the standard guns mounted on surface ships.  These guns were more waterproof due to the requirement for continuous immersion in salt water while the submarine was submerged.  Minimizing corrosion was important to prevent misfires.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5411;Radar removed the advantage of darkness from the submarine.  Enemy surface ships and planes with decimetric radar sets were able to detect the surfaced submarines still on the surface.  The decimetric radar detector would allow the submarine to start diving before the radar signal would reach sufficient levels that the submarine would be detected.  Historically, this was the German Metox radar detector.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5410;These are simple sound filters that will allow the operator to filter out background noise.  This is important in detecting targets at a distance.  By being able to pick up a target at a distance allows the submarine to move into position ahead of the target and track it longer.  It also allows the submarine to make more effective evasive maneuvers while avoiding attacking escorts.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5409;Improvements in optics for fire control systems allowed for improvements in periscope technology as well.  The visual accuracy allowed for better ranging of targets.  The ranging was accomplished by using the height of the target on a reticule within the periscope.  These more accurate optics will make the submarine more effective.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5408;Improvements in electronics allowed for improvements in detection equipment.  These new hydrophones were more precise than the old 'Y Tube' detectors that were previously mounted.  These new detectors had numerous receivers that were directional.  These hydrophones are placed in an arc that will allow for more precise directional information.  This allowed the submarine to make more effective attacks and evade counterattacks more easily.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5407;One of the difficulties with submarine operations was insufficient supplies and range for extended operations.  This meant that a method had to be devised to supply submarines while still at sea.  Early in the war, a complex network of merchant vessels was used to resupply the submarines at sea, but they proved vulnerable to attack.  The solution to this was to build a submarine that could resupply other submarines at sea.  Historically, this was the German Type XIV-class (milch-cow) U-Boat.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5406;The use of electric propulsion was experimented with before the war, but battery technology wasn't able to give the torpedo sufficient range to be effective.  With advances in battery technology, the concept of an electric torpedo became viable.  Electric torpedoes didn't leave a wake on the surface to alert the target of the incoming torpedo.  It also meant that it was more difficult for the escorting destroyers to trace where the torpedo came from and attack the submarine.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5400;With the outbreak of war, it was discovered that many of the preconceptions that effected submarine designs during the interwar period were no longer valid.  One of the big differences was the almost immediate start to unrestricted submarine warfare.  Although many countries had agreed that submarines would follow the 'Rules of War' in the regard of prize laws.  Merchant ships were armed with weapons which meant that submarines had to make attacks without warning to avoid attacks.  This meant that new equipment had to be developed to operate under these conditions.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5311;The improvements in the hulls and power plants for submarines meant that the units were much more capable than before.  Their range was longer, and they were more effective at attacking protected convoys with their higher speeds.  These were the mainline submarines that served as the heart of most nation's submarine forces for most of the war.  Historically, this was the German Type VIIC-class U-Boats and Italian Marcello-class submarines.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5310;Improvements in the design of submarines are usually incorporated into smaller submarines before they are brought into the mainline fleet boats.  The improvements in pressure hull construction and power were fairly easy to adapt to the short range submarines.  Historically, this was the German Type IID-class U-Boats.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5309;The use of welding made the submarine hull stronger.  With a riveted hull, the hull plates are held together with large metal studs.  With welding the two plates are joined on the edge effectively making one plate.  This means that the structure of the hull in stronger.  The stronger hull means that the submarine can dive deeper and be built more quickly.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5308;During attacks by enemy anti-submarine forces, one of the limiting factors was the amount of time that the submarine could stay submerged.  The amount of oxygen was the main limiting factor.  When carbon dioxide level reached 7% it would be fatal to the crew.  The first type of air scrubber was basically a fire fighting OBA (Oxygen Breathing Apparatus) canister which would use a chemical process to emit oxygen.  This was a limited solution as it would only give additional time measured in minutes, but sometimes that would be enough to make the difference between survival and destruction.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5307;The difficulty with previous charging systems was the use of separate propulsion and charging engines.  This resulted in a large percentage of the hull volume being taken up by the engineering spaces.  The new concept uses the same engines for propulsion and battery charging.  The generator used for charging is attached to a power take off on the forward side of the diesel engine.  The power that the engine can devote to moving the submarine is reduced while charging, but it frees up space within the hull for additional torpedo storage.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5306;Improvements in energy storage technology found their way into the submarines.  These improvements resulted in batteries that could hold two or three times the charge of previous cells.  These cells were installed in chains within the hull to provide power while the submarine was operating underwater.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5305;Improvements in anti-submarine tactics and equipment meant that submarines had to be able to operate at deeper depths than before.  Early submarines were able to operate at depths of around 60m (200 ft).  If this could be increased, it would allow submarines to operate deeper than the operational depth for depth charges.  These pressure hulls are designed to operate at depths of 75m (250 ft).;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5300;The next generation of submarines was designed using the experience that was gained during the period between the two world wars.  The technology that was developed would be used to design the next generation of submarines that would form the backbone of submarine forces for most of the war.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5219;Operations in large ocean areas requires a lot of range.  The concept is to have the submarine able to have enough fuel and provisions to transit to the patrol site and still be able to return to base without further refueling.  This design is the culmination of the first generation of submarine designs.  They are designed to operate both against commerce and against enemy naval units.  Historically, this was the British Parthian-class submarines and German Type IXA-class U-Boats.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5218;These are large submarines designed to carry one or two floatplanes.  The submarine has a large hangar located forward of the conning tower which holds the aircraft partially assembled.  When it is time to launch the aircraft, it is moved out onto the forward deck where the final assembly takes place.  The aircraft is launched from a catapult that is mounted into the forward deck.  These aircraft are used for scouting purposes as well as independent operations like sneak air attacks.  Historically, this was the Japanese Kaigun Dai-class submarines.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5217;The concept of the cruiser submarine grew out of the desire to have a submarine design that could also serve as a gunned commerce raider during wartime.  These submarines were characterized by a large gun armament, and a large hull.  The large hull made these submarines very slow to dive, and unmaneuverable while operating underwater.  Historically, this was the US Argonaught-class and the French Surcouf-class submarines.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5216;Following the Great War, the concept was put forward of large 'cruiser submarines' armed with a heavy gun armament that would serve as commerce raiders in a time of war.  The main armament for these submarines is a 152mm (6 inch) gun which has been modified for use on submarines.  This gun has additional waterproofing, and a smaller shell to facilitate operations onboard the submarine.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5215;The use of aircraft aboard a submarine would improve the ability of the submarine to scout for the battlefleet and to conduct independent operations.  The aircraft is housed in a watertight hangar mounted on the forward end of the submarine.  A catapult runs along the forward deck of the submarine for launching the aircraft.  The submarine is vulnerable to attack while air operations are happening.  The submarine has to remain on the surface while the aircraft is assembled and launched.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5214;The development of heavy torpedoes for surface ships allowed for longer range torpedoes that had larger warheads.  Unfortunately, submarine torpedo tubes were not as readily adaptable for conversion to the larger torpedo due to the physical location of the tubes as a part of the submarine's hull.  The submarine needs to be extensively modified to provide storage space and new torpedo tubes for the larger tubes.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5213;Diving the submarine beneath the surface is a dangerous undertaking.  Because the process is so dangerous, numerous accidents occurred during the development of submarines and following their deployment with the fleet.  This required the development of specialized equipment to rescue the submariners following an accident and to recover the submarine.  The equipment consists of a diving bell which is lowered from a support vessel located on the surface.  The diving bell is attached to one of the hatches on the submarine and the hatch is opened.  After the hatch is closed, the diving bell is raised to the surface.  The process is repeated until the entire crew has been evacuated.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5212;Air conditioning is used to keep the interior of the submarine cool.  Air conditioning works by circulating a coolant through a closed system.  This coolant is pumped into the piping on the cooling side of the system under pressure.  This coolant is allowed to expand at a controlled rate.  The expansion of the coolant absorbs heat as it evaporates into a gas.  The gas is returned to a compressor which removes the heat and returns the coolant to a liquid form where it can be used for cooling again.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5211;This device is valuable for determining the depth of the water beneath the submarine.  This is important due to the errors that are present in the charts for many parts of the world.  If a submarine is unsure of the depth of the water beneath, then the submarine could be damaged during a dive.  The device sends out a sound wave which is bounced off the seafloor and received by a hydrophone.  It is a simple matter of calculating the distance based on the time it took for the signal to go from the boat to the seafloor and back.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5210;The magnetic detonator works by detecting the variances in the Earth's magnetic field that a metal ship hull creates.  As the torpedo moves through the water, it will detect the changes in the magnetic field and detonate under the target.  This will hopefully break the ship in two as it vents the force of the explosion straight up into the most vulnerable spot on the ship.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5209;The calculations for hitting a moving target with a torpedo requires a lot of calculations in order to have any chance of success.  Although these calculations are not difficult, they are time consuming.  By building a mechanical computer to perform these calculations, it makes the process faster and less prone to error.  The problem with these computers is the fact that while the calculations are being run, no part of the data can change.  This includes the course of the target and the course of the firing submarine.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5208;The use of long range radios on submarines allows for better coordination of attacks by individual submarines.  The ocean is a large area to search, so the ability to transmit sighting reports to a central location that can pass the information onto the other submarines gives a large advantage.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5207;Diesel engines were a relatively new technology when they started to be mounted in submarines.  These early diesel engines were not very reliable and were largely made individually.  The refinement of the technology allowed for better reliability of the engines and for increased production.  Another side effect of increased reliability was the decrease in fuel consumption.  This allowed the submarines to have greater range.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5206;Early submarines had their fuel tanks mounted outside of the pressure hull.  This made them vulnerable to damage and also allowed leaks from the riveted construction of the fuel tanks themselves.  By moving the fuel tanks inside the pressure hull, it protected them from damage and helped to keep the fuel from being contaminated by seawater.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5205;Submarine hulls had been optimized for operations on the surface.  With the emphasis on attacks from underwater, a higher priority was placed on underwater speed and maneuverability.  This required a longer hull form and larger control surfaces.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5200;After the Great War, most of the investment in naval technology slowed down.  Much of this was due to the Washington Naval Treaty, but another part of it was due to the state of the world economy.  Most of the nations (other than Germany) continued with submarine research, but with the surplus of submarines left over from the war, there was little new construction.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5111;Operations outside the North Sea against British commerce, required a submarine with longer range and more firepower.  These submarines have the longer range required for operations outside of the littoral zone near the coast that is required for operations against protected convoys.  Historically, this was the British L-class submarines and German U-43 class U-Boats.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5110;The 127mm (5 inch) deck gun is more powerful than the 102mm gun that was mounted on submarines prior to and during the Great War.  During the war, it was discovered that submarines often used their deck gun in attacks made while operating on the surface.  In part this was due to the fact that early submarines didn't carry many torpedoes, so they were fairly precious.  The 102mm gun was discovered to lack the stopping power for the larger merchant vessels that were being built.  The new 127mm gun fires a smaller shell than the standard surface model to ease the storage requirements.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5109;A hydrophone is basically a microphone that can be mounted underwater.  This allows the submarine to hear destroyers that are hunting them, allowing them to better evade attacks.  These microphones were directional which also helped narrow down the location of the attacking destroyers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5108;The pressure of the water can be used to determine the depth of the submarine.  A hydrostatic depth gauge works with a metal bellows which expands or is compressed depending on the depth of the water pressing on the bellows.  This bellow is attached through a set of gears to a needle which reads the depth on the gauge.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5107;The development of the gyroscopic compass allowed for more accurate navigation while submerged.  A traditional magnetic compass works by a magnet that points toward magnetic north (different than true north).  This reading is further deviated by the steel of the hull and the movement of any metal within the hull.  A gyro compass works through a gyroscope which will track true north without error from the steel hull.  The drawback to this system is the size and weight of the gyro compass itself.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5106;Reloading torpedoes can be a brutal process that was typically done while surfaced.  While operating in enemy waters it was difficult to accomplish.  A mechanical system replaced the manpower intensive system which relied on block and tackle dating from the days of sail.  This allowed torpedoes to be reloaded more quickly and while submerged.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5105;The war showed the necessity of quick diving to escape attacks by destroyers.  The ballast tank design was improved by making the individual ballast tanks smaller and making the intakes for water larger.  This allowed that tanks to fill more quickly and allowed the submarine to dive more quickly.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5104;Experience during the first world war allowed for improvements in the torpedoes that were to be used by the submarines.  One of the largest improvements was the increase in diameter in submarine torpedoes to 533mm (21 inch).  This allowed submarines to attack from longer ranges and have higher speed torpedoes.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5100;The first world war was the first conflict where submarines took a large role in naval combat.  The Germans and British used their submarines from the beginning of the war in an anti-naval unit role.  They followed the 'rules of war' which said that commerce warfare would still work the same way that it worked during the Napoleonic Wars.  The introduction of unrestricted submarine warfare meant that any target in the war zone could be attacked without warning, warships and merchant vessels alike.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5015;This is the first mass produced submarine design that is available.  These submarines have a very short range and are most useful for defense of coastlines and harbors.  Their short range prevents their use for extensive commerce interdiction.  Historically, this was the US L-class submarines and the German U-31 class U-boats.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5014;A deck gun for use on a submarine has several differences from a weapon of the same caliber used on a surface warship.  These guns have to be able to stay immersed in salt water for long periods of time and still be serviceable.  This requires waterproofing on the gun and its controls.  There also has to be a different ammunition supply method due to the limited space onboard the submarine.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5013;The torpedoes used on submarines was basically the same torpedo that was used by surface ships.  These torpedoes had to be modified to be used onboard the submarine.  The primary difference between submarine torpedoes and surface torpedoes was the diameter of the weapon.  Early submarines were too small to use the heavy 533mm (21 inch) torpedoes that were commonly used on surface ships.  The smaller torpedoes used by submarines meant that they had shorter range and smaller warheads than their surface launched counterparts.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5012;The periscope allows attacks to be made while submerged.  A periscope is basically a hollow tube fitted with mirrors that allows a lens above the water to transmit an image down to the commander in the conning tower.  The length of the periscope was what determined 'periscope depth' for the submarine.  This was the greatest depth that the submarine could submerge to and still be able to carry out an attack.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5011;This is system for recharging the battery banks that are used for underwater propulsion.  These chargers are connected to diesel engines that can only be used to charge the batteries while surfaced.  This limits the underwater endurance of submarines.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5010;Initial submersible designs used human power while submerged.  This had limitation as to the size of the submarine and the underwater performance.  The inclusion of large banks of batteries would give the submarine the ability to move and maneuver while submerged.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5009;Early submarines used simple gasoline engines for propulsion.  The problem with gasoline engines is the flammability of the fuel.  Gasoline fumes could build up in the hull where the proved to be a hazard to the crew and the submarine.  By using diesel for the fuel, it gave the submarine better range and better survivability.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5008;Initial submarine experiments had hulls where they were kept underwater entirely by weight of the water in tanks.  This resulted in unreliable underwater performance due to the free surface effect of partially flooded ballast tanks.  This new design relies on horizontal rudders on the bow and stern called planes to maintain depth.  The submarine is designed to be neutrally buoyant with all of the ballast tanks full.  This gives the submarine better underwater performance.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5007;The training of crews to man the submarines takes special schools.  You can't just take a man off a surface warship and expect him to be a submariner.  The establishment of training schools for the volunteers and the provision for trained personnel ashore to maintain the submarines is necessary before deployment of submarines can begin.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5006;The first submarines were all unique designs.  These submarines served as prototypes to determine what were desirable characteristics in a design.  Once these characteristics had been determined, standardized designs could be produced in greater numbers for use with the fleet.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_5000;The first successful submarine attack occurred during the American civil war when the Confederate submersible Hunley sank the Federal frigate Houstatonic.  This proved that submarines could be effective for coastal defense.  A truly effective submarine design would have to wait until John Holland launched his first submarine in 1897.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_4974;Many nations in this era had primarily agrarian economies, based on food production and export.  They had little need for rubber, tungsten and other rare materials to power their light industries.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_4803;Late war designs, such as high velocity tank cannons, advanced vehicles and new types of planes required new standards of quality. Thanks to new methods of control and constant development of production process new, almost experimental designs, could be put into mass production almost instantly.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_4405;The Small Arms Assembly Construction Process allowed small arms to be assembled in vast quantities at one production site. This allowed infantry units to be produced quickly and inexpensively.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_4104;The partial sterilization treatment of a liquid such as milk by heating it in order to destroy harmful bacteria (increased Pasteurization), leads to better preservation of food, lower waste and better health.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_4103;Introduction to elements and compounds, chemical bonds, formulas and equations, this leads to research and development into many other related fields.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_4005;In the first half (1939-1943) of World War II German economy worked on the slow pace, not switching entirely to 'war mode'. That was mostly due to the political reasons - Germany was apparently winning the war, so there was no sense in mobilizing the industry. All have changed in 1943, when Germany suffered some major defeats including capitulation of the whole 6th Army in Stalingrad cauldron and allied landing in Africa. Facing combined forces of USA, USSR and UK Germany mobilized their industry by using workforce from occupied countries and redeploying production facilities to counter Allied bomber offensive. While very effective in terms of quantity, it also resulted in lower quality of the equipment and weapons.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_4004;This technology grants you a serious challenge by raising costs of R&D and units training. Also supplying existing units will be much more challenging.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_4003;This technology is intended to block special AI techs for human players. This technology is locked for AI's.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_4002;This technology is intended to allow AI's to develop technologies disabled for human players, as well as modify starting position of AI to allow it more competitive and effective R&D work. This technology is locked for human players.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2999;After the war, tank technology advanced slowly, with scientific analysis of armor and firepower allowing much greater protection than believed possible under weight limitations.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2998;The medium assault gun (75mm+ Medium) was based off a modified basic medium tank chassis, and mounted a medium 75mm+ Anti-Tank Gun. Historically, this was the German Sturmgeschutz III and Sturmgeschutz IV;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2997;These launchers were mounted on the sides of the turret, and when the tank was in trouble, the crew could trigger them from inside the tank, creating a instant smoke screen that could be used for defensive purposes.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2996;Anti-Personnel Land-mines were mounted on the sides of the turret, and when the tank was being assaulted by infantry close in, the crew could electrically trigger them from inside, killing the attacking infantry.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2995;A 80mm+ mortar is mounted inside the tank for use against attacking infantry and to provide smoke with smoke rounds. Historically, this was the German Nahverteidigungswaffe.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2994;A small tank equipped with a remote control is used by engineer units to carry a large quantity of high explosives to a target and then detonate the explosives, destroying both itself and the target. Historically, this was the German Goliath.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2993;Infantry support tanks were based around the Great War concept of the land battleship, advancing with infantry and breaking defenses thanks to turrets containing cannons or machine guns. Historically, this was the British Matilda I and II, French Renault R35 and Japanese Type 89 I-Go. Battalions of those were usually added to the units assaulting heavy fortified enemy positions.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2992;Armored cars were used successfully in the Great War and they remained an important part of the arsenal of many countries in the inter-war years.  They were used in formations up to brigade size by some nations to fulfil roles previously conducted by horse cavalry, with armored car units normally attached on a battalion or brigade basis to an infantry force. Heavier armored cars were armed with tank cannons rather than machine guns which allowed them to be used in an anti-tank role, relying on superior mobility rather than armor to avoid destruction.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2991;Armored cars were used successfully in the Great War and they remained an important part of the arsenal of many countries in the inter-war years.  They were used in formations up to brigade size by some nations to fulfil roles previously conducted by horse cavalry, with armored car units normally attached on a battalion or brigade basis to an infantry force. Most armored cars were armed with medium or heavy machine guns, making them primarily useful against infantry and cavalry.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2990;Sloped Armour had existed to some degree in armored vehicles for many years. But not until World War II was it practically implemented in the overall design of tanks. The sloped armor increased the protection of armored vehicles without adding actual armor and weight. Instead the sloping armor could redirect a projectile, allowing it to skid off the vehicle's hull.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2989;During the late 1930s, development of the tanks as fast, attack weapons was still countered by their 'traditional' role - infantry support. One of the designs prepared for this role was flame tank - usually standard light or medium tank with main armament (gun) replaced by heavy flamethrower. Flame tanks weapons had extremely short range, but were quite effective against fortified positions, as well as in jungle fighting. Historically those were German Pz III Flamm, Soviet OT-26 and OT-34 and US modifications of M4 Sherman.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2988;This tankette was armed with a single .50 caliber Machine Gun. Historically, this was the British Carden-Loyd Mark VI an polish TK/TKS.Since their inability to survive on the battlefield, tankettes often were used as a scout vehicles.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2987;This tankette was armed with a single .30 caliber Machine Gun. Historically, this was the British Carden-Loyd Mark I. Since their inability to survive on the battlefield, tankettes often were used as a scout vehicles.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2986;A theory was put forward by the great French tank enthusiast General Estienne, who helped design France's first tank and was a proponent of the light tank, of the idea of skirmishers armed with light tanks rushing an enemy position. The idea was that the massive onslaught by a high speed and protected group of soldiers would be unstoppable in action. These tanks would be called Tankettes, and would have a crew of one man.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2985;Infantry support tanks were based around the Great War concept of the land battleship, advancing with infantry and breaking defenses thanks to multiple turrets containing cannons or machine guns. Historically, this was the German PzKpfw.NbFw.V;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2984;Engineering tanks used specialized equipment and weapons to assist engineers in clearing obstacles and fortifications in front of the advancing troops. Historically, this was the Churchill AVRE, which mounted a 290mm spigot-type mortar gun known as the 'Petard', capable of damaging severely even the most sturdiest of fortifications.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2983;The tank was a formidable opponent on the battlefield due to its protection and speed. It could be found alongside infantry, used in conjunction with other mechanized equipment or combined into a tank unit depending on the doctrine by which it was employed. The Advanced Medium Tank (75mm+ Medium).;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2982;After the first period of war it became obvious, that traditional methods of repairs not suit new, fast style of warfare. In battles most of the tanks were not destroyed, but damaged. Vehicles that were knocked off or received damage beyond their own ability to repair had to wait for repair teams, thus slowing the advance. The answer for that problem was the heavy evacuation vehicle, able to remove damaged tank right from the battlefield even under enemy fire and repair it right on the front line. Historically those vehicles were modifications of standard medium and heavy tanks, like M4 Sherman, Cromwell or Churchill.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2981;The tank was a formidable opponent on the battlefield due to its protection and speed. It could be found alongside infantry, used in conjunction with other mechanized equipment or combined into a tank unit depending on the doctrine by which it was employed. The Improved Medium Tank (75mm+ Long) was equipped with a 70mm+ Long Tank Gun allowing it to defeat soft and medium armored targets. Historically this was the British A30 Challenger with a 17-pounder gun, and rebuilt lend-lease Sherman Fireflies.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2980;The new breed of tanks combined both speed, firepower, and armor into a package that had been impossible just a few years ago. Examples of the new class of Main Battle Tanks, as they were now being called, were the Soviet T-54, the American M-46 Patton, and the British Centurion Mk. III.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2978;The post war tank used the latest armoring techniques to allow for more protection on less weight than thought possible before. Sometimes those vehicles used modified versions of standard large caliber howitzers, as it was much easier to manufacture and support. Historically, those models of tanks (like Russian IS-2 and IS-3) were put into service at the end or just after the war and become predecessors of modern main battle tanks.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2977;The post war tank used the latest armoring techniques to allow for more protection on less weight than thought possible before. Historically, this was the British Centurion.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2976;The post war tank used the latest armoring techniques to allow for more protection on less weight than thought possible before. Historically, this was the American M-46.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2975;The tanks of the immediate post-war period had been designed in the closing days of the war, and as such, had not finished testing in time to participate in the war.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2974;Due to experience gained with the early war tanks, tank tracks were re-designed to be more efficient in moving a tank around, with less wasteage of fuel and less wear and tear on the engine.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2973;As the war progressed, it became apparent that some design features of tanks actually harmed their chances of survival, by allowing enemy shells to ricochet off certain areas and into thinner and less well-armored areas of the tank. The identification and removal of these so-called 'shot traps' greatly improved tank survival rates.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2970;Now that the hectic pace of the war was over, a more leisurely and orderly approach to tank design could be followed, implementing all the lessons learned over the war years into a single coherent whole. This new tank design would replace both the medium and heavy tanks with a single tank known as the Main Battle Tank.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2960;The Schmalturm (Narrow) turret was the result of a scientific study on the percentages of hits that a tank received on a particular arc. The front was found to be hit the most, and by narrowing the turret, a dramatic increase in frontal turret armor could be achieved. Historically, this was the German Schmalturm turret designed for the Panther II.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2956;A .30 Caliber machine gun was mounted typically near the commander's hatch in a special mount designed for defense against attacking aircraft. Historically, this was the US M1919A6 in the AAMG role.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2955;A .50 Caliber machine gun was mounted typically near the commander's hatch in a special mount designed for air defense against attacking aircraft. Historically, this was the US M2HB in the AAMG role.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2943;Armored cars were used successfully in the Great War and they remained an important part of the arsenal of many countries in the inter-war years.  They were used in formations up to brigade size by some nations to fulfil roles previously conducted by horse cavalry, with armored car units normally attached on a battalion or brigade basis to an infantry force. Most armored cars were armed with medium or heavy machine guns, making them primarily useful against infantry and cavalry.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2942;While very attractive on the drawing boards, the whole super-heavy tank concept met serious problems when it come to implementation stage. Historically, units of super-heavy tanks never existed - Germans had 3 prototypes of 'Maus' tank and USA only toyed with the idea. If those tanks were ever put into action though, they would be used in small units attached to the larger, standard tank formations - just like earlier German Tiger battalions and Soviet IS regiments.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2936;The post war tank used the latest armoring techniques to allow for more protection on less weight than thought possible before. Historically, those models of tanks were put into service at the end or just after the war and become predecessors of modern main battle tanks. 120mm long barrel tank gun was at the time ultimate anti-tank weapon and vehicles armed with this were ultimate tank-killers of the late war period as well.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2935;As the war progressed, concept of armored cars developed from the mobile infantry support weapon to scouting vehicle, capable of long-range raids at the spearhead of the armored columns. Historically those were UK Staghound Mk. I-II, USA M8 Greyhound and German Sd Kfz 234/2 Puma.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2934;Many tank crews welded applique armor consisting of armor plates salvaged from wrecked tanks over critical spots on their tanks, improving the armor thickness in those areas.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2887;Refinements to HEAT ammunition allowed for greater velocity in mid-air than with the older HEAT rounds, and also greater penetrative power.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2886;The application of Shaped Charge technology to conventional weapon ammunition created a new type of shell, the HEAT shell, which allowed even low velocity weapons to be able to knock out heavy tanks in a single shot.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2885;Now that the Shaped Charge had been proven in combat, improvements were made, leading to greater penetrative power for the same weight of explosives.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2884;The Shaped Charge dates back to the 1880s, but it was not until the 1930s and 1940s when it was scientifically analyzed. This would lead to a new type of weapon that was lightweight, yet capable of punching through incredible quantities of armor.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2866;The first intercontinental bombers required special, new airframes to support extreme weight and size of the new planes.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2863;Supersonic planes required special, new technologies to work in extreme conditions of supersonic speeds.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2862;New bombers required special, new technologies to achieve supersonic speeds.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2800;As World War II ground to a fiery halt, radical new systems were tested and fielded by both sides in a desperate attempt to gain the upper hand.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2705;Unlike early war heavy tanks, vehicles like Pz VI Tiger or KW were mobile enough to support large tank formations without slowing them down. Better protection granted by armor and mobility made units armed with those tanks real elites.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2703;The early war heavy tanks carried thick armor and reasonable firepower, but had little, if no mobility. Most of the time, heavy tank battalions were used as a reserve units - either to break heavy fortified enemy positions or to deny enemy breakthrough.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_2700;As World War II progressed, tank design improved and became more efficient and deadly as flaws were identified and corrected.;;;;;;;;;;X

CTECD_2006;Tanks were first used in World War One to break the stalemate of the trenches. Most were armed with either machine guns or cannon. In some examples, both cannon and machine guns were fitted. Historically, this was the British Mark V tank.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_1977;The new improved General-Purpose Machine Gun, or GPMG, was an improvement over the previous model. It kept all of its advantages, but corrected its failings and took advantage of the latest advances in weapons technology and the experience achieved during the war. Like its predecessor, it could be changed from a light machine gun in support of an infantry squad to a heavy machine gun in the fire support role by simply mounting it onto a tripod and/or changing the feeding method from drums to belts. It was designed to be capable of holding sustained fire during long periods of time, using fast barrel change methods to minimize barrel weariness. Those changes were so fast that a 3 men MG group could perform it at the same time that the ammunition belt was changed. Historically, this was the German MG-42. Other countries adopted this design after the war and used it to make their own GPMGs, like the American M60.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_1976;The General-Purpose Machine Gun, or GPMG, was a completely new concept. It used the standard 7.62mm+ rifle caliber and was air-cooled, unlike the older water-cooled heavy machine guns of the past. It could be changed from a light machine gun in support of an infantry squad to a heavy machine gun in the fire support role by simply mounting it onto a tripod. Also, it could be belt or drum fed without having to modify the weapon at all. All these improvements made it very versatile and practical. Historically, this was the German MG-34.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_1975;The .30 caliber (7.62mm+) heavy machine gun remained essentially unchanged from its World War I origins, with only minor changes made to increase reliability, accuracy, and reduce weight. Historically this was the British Vickers .303 and French Hotchkiss;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_1974;The 120mm+ Heavy Mortar allowed infantry units to carry an even heavier punch than was possible with the older 81mm Mortars. Historically, the Russians were the first to come out with a 120mm mortar, the M-1938 120mm. Shortly after Operation Barbarossa, the Germans pressed captured Russian Mortars into service, and eventually produced a carbon copy of the M1938, the 12cm Granatwerfer 42.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_1944;Improvements in guidance and manufacturing methods allowed the guided anti-tank missile to achieve its true potential against all hard targets.  Apart from cost, the only major drawback is the time to target which can allow an enemy tank to fire back and disable or suppress the guide if the launch flash is detected.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14995;Those machine guns were direct evolution of Great War fighter planes armament, but of much better quality, rate of fire and ammo support. While not very effective against heavier targets, those guns served quite well against other fighter planes. Historically this was the American M2 .303 Browning, the British Vickers VGO .303;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14987;Among the best mountain guns ever built, large numbers of these weapons survived the war and were to be found in service with a number of European countries until the middle 1960s.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14986;Further research and development into self-propelled AA systems corrected the faults of the earlier systems, making the new ones more deadly. This system also used the newly developed 50mm+ AA Gun. Historically, this was the Russian ZSU-57-2 Sparka.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14984;Further research and development into self-propelled AA systems corrected the faults of the earlier systems, making the new ones more deadly. Historically, this was the American M-42 Duster.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14983;Further research and development into self-propelled AA systems corrected the faults of the earlier systems, making the new ones more deadly. Historically, this was the German Flakpanzer IV (3cm) Kugelblitz.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14982;The 70mm+ Recoilless Gun was the first of it's kind, and was designed for parachute units, so they could have a hard-hitting gun that was light and yet packed a strong punch. Historically, this was the German 75mm LG 40 Recoilless Gun and the American 75mm Recoiless M20;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14981;This remarkable howitzer was the heaviest weapon ever developed for mountain use. Among the best mountain guns ever built, large numbers of these weapons survived the war and were to be found in service with a number of European countries until the middle 1960s. Historically, this was the German Geb H 40 105mm Mountain Howitzer.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14980;This was a 75mm+ Field Gun, but designed to have high elevation and be broken up into several easily manageable pieces that could then be transported by a few men each or pack animals. Historically, this was the German GebG 36 75mm Mountain Gun.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14979;This low velocity gun fired a very large HE charge, and was found mostly on engineering vehicles. Examples included the British 290mm 'Spigot' Mortar known as the 'Petard' found on the Churchill AVRE.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14978;Even 30mm cannons in ground attack aircraft were proving to have a hard time penetrating the armor of heavy tanks, and the answer was found in a modified 75mm cannon that had reduced recoil mountings. These cannons were so heavy and cumbersome that they could only be mounted in tactical bombers. Historically, this was the German 75mm BK 7.5 and the American 75mm M-4 Cannon. Later, these cannon were modified to fit onto Advanced Light Tanks such as the American M-24 Chafee.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14977;The 75mm+ (Long) tank gun had nearly as much hitting power as the larger 88mm tank gun, but with less explosive power against unarmored targets. Historically, this was the German 75mm KwK 42 L/70 used on the Panther, and the British 17-pounder gun used on the Sherman Firefly and A30 Challenger.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14976;The 75mm (Medium) tank gun had moderate hitting power, and historically was the US M3 75mm gun, the German 75mm KwK 40 L/43.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14975;Soon, even 20mm cannons weren't enough to bring down the newest aircraft, and so, technicians looked ahead, to the 30mm cannon, which was capable of downing even the sturdiest fighter in one shot, and destroying a bomber in three. Examples included the German MK108 cannon.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14974;As aircraft became faster and more sturdy, more firepower was needed to bring them down. Machine guns soon found themselves supplanted by 20mm and above cannons, which had the punch to down fighters in a few shots.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14973;These machine guns replaced the earlier 7.62mm+ MGs (.30 Cal), and had greater range and firepower than the older rifle caliber guns. Examples of these new guns were the American M2 .50 Browning, the German MG131 (13mm).;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14945;The 50mm+ Anti-Air gun gave light AA units a more powerful, harder hitting gun that could reach out farther than the old 40mm guns. Historically, this was the Russian 57 mm S60 cannon.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14652;The 85mm+ Recoilless Gun was designed for parachute and mountain units, so they could have a hard-hitting gun that was light and yet packed a strong punch but was very expensive. Historically, this was the German 88mm RW 43 P¸ppchen;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14650;New advances in artillery since the Great War has resulted in a modern and significantly more effective range of Heavy Artillery;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14602;This 200mm+ Heavy Artillery Gun was used by a few major powers. It was reliable and had an acceptable rate of fire and a medium range, although clumsy and fed with huge and heavy shells.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14601;The 150mm+ to Infantry Gun was frequently used by many nations. Originally an elderly field artillery piece it was converted into infantry use. It retained the horrible range of the 70mm+ Infantry Gun but was too heavy to be used in the assault role but was very potent in breaking up enemy attacks;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14550;Advances in tank armor and speed have resulted in the demand for an anti-tank gun capable of destroying this new generation of armored fighting vehicles;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14503;The 85mm+ Tank Gun was a heavy gun capable of inflicting damage on armored vehicles. It could penetrate the armor of Medium Tanks and Heavy Tanks;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14452;Muzzle Brakes redirect much of the gas out of the side of the barrel rather than its end. This greatly reduces the recoil of the gun, resulting in more accurate artillery, anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14451;Powered Anti-Air Gun mounts drastically increased the effectiveness of light anti-aircraft guns. Their primary use was on board naval vessels but some were found on ground mountings;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14450;Advances in tank armor and speed have resulted in the demand for an anti-tank gun capable of destroying this new generation of armored fighting vehicles;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14404;This Self-Propelled Artillery piece had a gun caliber comparable with the infantry guns and field artillery guns. Combined with its mobility and protection its lethality on the battlefield was virtually unmatched. Historically this was the US M7 Priest and the German Wespe;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14352;The 100mm+ Recoilless Gun was designed for parachute units, so they could have a hard-hitting gun that was light and yet packed a strong punch. Historically, this was the German 105mm LG 42 Recoilless Gun.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14351;This 50mm+ Anti-Tank Gun was the first effective tank-killer used by the infantry. It was designed to penetrate tank armor and it had a high enough caliber to kill Light Tanks and to damage Medium Tanks. Its main deficits were its moderate armor penetration power and its medium range - which was less than most Tank Guns - thus the gun was less effective when protecting friendly armor. Historically this was the German 50mm PAK 38 and the British 6-Pounder;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14350;As the armor of tanks increased basic Anti-Tank Guns proved to be incapable of knocking them out. A new group of Anti-Tank Guns, ranging from 50mm and 75mm, was developed to counter the new tanks;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14306;This Self-Propelled Artillery piece had a fairly light caliber gun and thus could not achieve the same target destruction as the infantry guns and field artillery guns but due to its mobility and protection its overall lethality on the battlefield was almost identical.  Historically this was the British Bishop, Canadian Sexton and the Italian Semovente 90/53;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14302;This 170mm+ Heavy Artillery Gun was used by some major powers. It was reliable and had an acceptable rate of fire and a long range. With very few deficiencies, it was one of the most powerful field artillery pieces produced during the war. Historically, this was the German K18 Gun and British 7.2 inch Howitzer;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14265;This gun was a major improvement over previous 305mm (12 inch) guns and was of simpler, lighter construction.  Designed to fire 'super heavy' armor piercing shells, it gave penetration almost the equal of pre-war 356mm naval guns.  The gun fires a 500 kg (1150 lb) shell to a range of 19 nm (35 km).;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14264;Improved Anti-Aircraft Guns featured the high rates of fire of Light Anti-Aircraft Guns with a heavy shell and high range of Heavy Aint-Aircraft Guns;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14263;New advances in artillery since the Great War has resulted in a modern and significantly more effective range of Medium Artillery.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14262;New advances in artillery since the Great War has resulted in a modern and significantly more effective range of Mountain Guns.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14261;This class of 203mm (8 inch) guns use separate (cased) powder in place of bags of powder.  With automatic shell handling and loading, a fire rate of three times greater than previous 203mm guns was possible.  These guns fire a 150 kg (330 lb) shell to a range of 15 nm (27 km).;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14260;The 152mm Dual-Purpose gun was developed for a new generation of modern Anti-Aircraft Cruisers. It was designed to fire at high angles for anti-aircraft defense as well as against surface targets. This gun fires an armored piercing or high explosive 50 kg (105 lb) shell to a range of 13 nm (21 km).;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14259;The 460mm (18 inch) naval gun is the heaviest gun afloat.  The gun fires a massive 1500 kg (3200 lb) shell to a range of 23 nm (42 km).  The construction of these guns is a complex process involving heating, shrinking, and expanding the various tubes that made up the barrel.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14258;This is an improvement of the 406mm (16 inch) naval gun to take advantage of advances in shell and gun construction.  The gun fires a 'super heavy' 406mm shell weighing about 1200 kg (2700 lbs) to a range of 21 nm (38 km).  At long ranges this gun can equal the heavier 460mm gun in penetrating power.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14257;The 406mm (16 inch) naval gun is an improvement of the older 356mm naval gun to fire a heavier shell. It is mounted in turrets with two or three guns. The heavier shell weight allows it to penetrate thicker armor. The shell travels on a flatter trajectory which makes it easier to hit a target at long ranges.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14256;The 356mm (14 inch) naval gun is an improvement of the older 305mm naval gun. It is mounted in turrets with two or three guns. The 356mm gun fires a heavier shell and achieves a higher muzzle velocity. This allows the gun to fire farther and penetrate thicker armor.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14255;The 305mm (12 inch) naval gun was the main battery weapon of early battleships. The gun is mounted in turrets with two or three guns per turret. The entire turret and understructure can rotate to train the guns on target. The lower levels of the turret (or barbette as it is known) contain handling rooms for shells and the bags of powder necessary to fire the guns. These guns have been in service with the major navies since before the first world war, but are a necessary step to heavier guns. This gun fired a 400 kg (870 lb) shell to a range of 10 nm (18 km);;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14254;The 254mm (10 inch) naval gun is the smallest of the heavy naval guns. The 254mm gun has separate bags of powder that can be moved onto the loading tray by a single person. The shell is placed on the loading tray and the shell and powder are rammed into the gun and the breach closed. These guns were the main armament of armored cruisers and second rate battleships prior to the first world war. This guns fires a 230 kg (510 lb) shell to a range of 10 nm (18 km).;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14253;This is a medium gun because of its size compared to battleship main guns, but it still fires a shell that is heavy enough to require a mechanical loading system. These guns serve as the main armament of heavy cruisers and as the secondary guns of pre-dreadnaught battleships. They are mounted in multiple gun turrets with light to heavy armor protection for the crew. This gun fires a 120 kg (260 lb) shell to a range of 16 nm (29 km).;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14252;This is a medium sized naval gun. It can serve either as the main armament of a cruiser or as the secondary guns on a battleship. These guns fire a separate shell and powder charge that allows each piece to be loaded by a single person.  On older cruisers these guns were mounted on deck without any armor protection for the crew, but in later cruisers they were mounted in multiple gun turrets. This gun fires a 50 kg (105 lb) shell to a range of 13 nm (21 km).;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14251;This is a small, lightweight naval gun that can be mounted as either the main armament on a destroyer or small cruiser, or as secondary or tertiary guns on battleships. The 127mm (5 inch) gun can be quickly loaded by a single person. These guns typically have a minimum amount of armor protection to protect the crew from splinters. This gun fires a 23 kg (50 lb) shell to a range of 10 nm (18 km).;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14250;This is a small, lightweight naval gun. The 102mm (4 inch) gun has a combined shell and powder charge allowing it to be reloaded quickly by a single person. The gun is mounted on deck without any armor protection for the gun crew. This gun serves as the gun armament on early or small destroyers. This gun fires a 15 kg (33 lb) shell to a range of 8 nm (14 km).;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14220;Towards the end of the war, Germany was working on a new concept called the Revolver Cannon, which was based on a revolving chamber loading and unloading the shells instead of a linear back-and-forth bolt action. It allowed rates of fire exceeding 1000+ rounds a minute, compared to a mere 600-700 for conventional cannon. Historically, this was the German MG213C.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14208;The 85mm+ Anti-Air Gun was an early heavy gun capable of targeting high-flying aircraft. As a bonus, it could also be used in an anti-tank role in a pinch, where it's high muzzle velocity proved to be invaluable in punching through the thick armor of heavy tanks.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14207;This gun was a modified 75mm+ Infantry Gun mounted for use in armored vehicles designed for close support duties. Historically, this was the German 75mm KwK 37 L/24 gun found on the Panzer IVA-F1.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14205;This 75mm+ Anti-Tank Gun was the first effective tank-killer used by the infantry. It was designed to penetrate tank armor and it had a high enough caliber to kill Light Tanks and to damage Medium Tanks. Historically this was the German 75mm PAK 40.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14158;Based upon the chassis of a Light Tank, the Self-Propelled Anti-Air Machine Gun offered armored and mechanized formations rudimentary defense against low flying aircraft. Historically this was the Vickers Mark V twin Besa 15mm and German Flakpanzer I;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14157;Mechanized Ammunition Carriers were vitally important in supplying Self-Propelled Artillery. They were basically unarmed Self-Propelled Artillery Tractors designed to carry and transfer large amounts of ammunition to active batteries of Self-Propelled Guns. Historically this was the German Munitiontr‰ger Wespe and Hummel;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14156;Motorized Artillery Carriers were capable of transporting larger amounts of supply faster and more efficiently than the traditional horse Artillery Carriers. Historically this was the German Sdkfz 7 and British Quad Gun Tractor;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14155;Developed from tankettes, these small tracked vehicles were used in large numbers to tow anti-tank guns and other loads for infantry and cavalry units. They were well suited for rough or harsh terrain. Historically they were the French Renault 37R, Belgian Vickers Utility tractor and British Universal Carrier;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14154;Most militaries developed Anti-Tank weaponry in between the ranges of 37mm and 40mm in the inter-war period. These weapons could easily penetrate contemporary armor and were produced in great numbers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14153;The 120mm+ to Infantry Gun was frequently used by many nations. Originally an elderly field artillery piece it was converted into infantry use. It retained the horrible range of the 70mm+ Infantry Gun but was too heavy to be used in the assault role but was very potent in breaking up enemy attacks;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14152;New advances in artillery since the Great War has resulted in a modern and significantly more effective range of Light Artillery;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14151;The Improved Gun Carriage increases the mobility of artillery pieces as well as the stability of the gun. They utilized modern pneumatic tires, high elevation, as well as contemporary recoil absorbers which increased gun accuracy as well as mobility;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14150;Improvements in Radio Communication and Optical Rangefinders resulted in drastically improved Fire Control systems which increased the accuracy of contemporary artillery;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14107;The 75mm+ Anti-Air Gun was an early heavy gun capable of targeting high-flying aircraft. It had a good rate of fire and an adequate range and was a capable anti-tank weapon;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14106;The 40mm+ Anti-Air Gun was a light gun capable of targeting low-flying aircraft. Historically this was the Swedish 40mm L/56 and the British Vickers 2-Pounder;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14103;This 120mm+ Field Artillery Gun was frequently used by many nations. It was reliable and had an acceptable rate of fire and a medium range. Historically this was the Soviet 122mm A-19 Model 1937 Howitzer and the British 4.5 inch Howitzer;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14102;The 100mm+ to Infantry Gun was frequently used by many nations. Originally an elderly field artillery piece it was converted into infantry use. It retained the horrible range of the 70mm+ Infantry Gun but was too heavy to be used in the assault role but was very potent in breaking up enemy attacks;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_1410;The semi-automatic carbine was developed in the interwar era and refined for mass production once the war began. These weapons were as accurate as bolt action carbine rifles but were more valuable on assaults. Historically this was the American M1A1;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_1409;The semi-automatic rifle was developed in the interwar era and refined for mass production once the war began. These weapons were as accurate as bolt action rifles but were more valuable on assaults. Historically this was the American M1 Garand;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14057;The Great War Gun Carrier was developed in order to transport heavy artillery and their ammunition across the battered and torn ground of the Western Front. Although not a full Self-Propelled Gun, it proved invaluable experience for future developments;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14056;Early Anti-Air Machine Guns were mounted on high-angled gun platforms and were used for protecting artillery batteries from low flying aircraft. As they became more common, they were later issued to infantry formations and on board ships but were only effective in discouraging attack and rarely hit anything. Traditionally these guns were landed aircraft machine guns or mounted Infantry LMGs;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14055;The 20mm+ Anti-Tank Gun was capable of piercing only thinly armored tanks and armored cars. Historically this was the French Canon Leger de 25 antichar mle 1934.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14054;The Great War era 240mm+ Heavy Artillery Gun was used by a few major powers. It was reliable and had an acceptable rate of fire and a medium range. It was well suited for static warfare common during the Great War;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14053;This was a Great War era 75mm+ Field Gun, but designed to have high elevation and be broken up into several easily manageable pieces that could then be transported by a few men each or pack animals. Historically, this was the Austrian Skoda 75mm Mountain Gun M1915;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14052;The Great War era 150mm+ Field Artillery Gun was used by many nations. It was reliable and had an acceptable rate of fire and a medium range. Its greatest deficit was that it only shot High Explosive shells and that ammunition was tricky to move about.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14051;The Great War era 75mm+ Field Artillery Gun was used by many nations. It was reliable and had a moderate rate of fire and range. Its penetration power was slightly worse than the heavier guns. Historically this was the French Canon de 75 mle 1897.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14050;High-Elevation Gun Carriages were specifically designed for extremely high elevations, required for both Mountain Howitzer and Anti-Aircraft Guns;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_1405;An advanced single-shot tube-launched rocket that was very effective against armored targets. It was very easy to use and was lightweight enough that it could be worn on the soldier's back. It was inexpensive to produce, easy to train with, and was ideal for untrained militia.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_1403;The first tube-launched anti-tank rockets introduced the shaped-charge (or HEAT) concept, which allowed a lightweight warhead to blast through incredible thicknesses of armor. These new weapons were a dramatic increase in the anti-tank firepower of the infantryman. No longer would he have to run from oncoming panzers, but he could blunt them and even stop them dead in their tracks now. Historically, this was the American Bazooka.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14013;The 37mm+ Anti-Air Gun was a light gun capable of targeting low-flying aircraft. Due to its light caliber it had limited capability. Historically this was the German 37mm FlaK 36;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14009;This 40mm+ Anti-Tank gun was a 'hot item' in the last years of the 1930s. It performed well against Light Tanks but was unable to damage the heavier princes of battle. As time went by it was outmoded by faster guns with greater range but it was still easy to use and rather effective against infantry. Historically it was the British 2-Pounder and the Italian Canone da 47/32 M35;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14008;This 37mm+ Anti-Tank gun was a 'hot item' in the last years of the 1930s. It performed well against Light Tanks but was unable to damage the heavier princes of battle. As time went by it was outmoded by faster guns with greater range but it was still easy to use and rather effective against infantry. Historically it was the German 3.7-cm PAK 36 and American M1A1 37mm.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14007;This 100mm+ Field Artillery Gun was used by many nations. It was reliable and had an acceptable rate of fire and a long range. Its penetration power was slightly worse than the heavier guns. Historically this was the American M2A1 105mm Field Gun.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14006;The 85mm+ Field Artillery Gun was a fairly new gun type. It fired a much heavier shell than the 75mm+ and had greater range while maintaining a high rate of fire as well as having sufficient muzzle velocity to make it an effective Anti-Tank weapon. Historically this was the British 25-Pounder Field Gun;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14005;The 75mm+ Field Artillery Gun was used by many nations. It was reliable and had a moderate rate of fire and range. Its penetration power was slightly worse than the heavier guns.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_14004;The 70mm+ Infantry Gun was frequently used by many nations. Originally an elderly field artillery piece it remained an important infantry gun. It has a horrible range but is light enough to be very useful in close assaults especially in rugged terrain. Historically it was the Japanese 70-mm Type 92;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13509;Protection of the sea lanes necessary for maritime commerce had been a focus for a majority of the war.  But it wasn't just enough to protect the sea lanes from attacks by submarines and commerce raiders.  It is necessary to control the sea lanes with naval power and prevent the enemy from operating within the area.  This requires good sensors to pinpoint enemy units and the ability to strike from great distances.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13508;The use of nuclear propulsion will free our naval vessels from the limitations of the fuel endurance.  Unfortunately, in addition to developing the technology required for nuclear propulsion we need to develop the infrastructure to support those nuclear vessels.  The development of standards for inspections, and for training of specialized engineering crews to man the vessels will have to be developed.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13507;The ability of carriers to project power onto the shore was limited by the range of the aircraft involved.  With the development of longer range aircraft, carriers were able to project naval power to targets which were previously out of reach.  This meant that naval aircraft were tasked to attack targets like factories, lines of communications, and other targets which had been reserved for land based aircraft.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13506;The development of a long range radar set that was small enough to mount on a carrier based aircraft, a specialized early warning aircraft was developed.  This allowed for the early detection of low flying aircraft because of the more distant radar horizon provided by the altitude of the aircraft.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13505;The use of small groups of escort carriers and destroyers or corvettes allowed the destruction of submarines before they could get into position to attack the convoys.  Aircraft from the carriers would make the first attack on the submarine and either sink it or drive it underneath the water where it was more difficult to leave the area.  Once the submarine was driven underwater, the destroyers would move in and complete the kill.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13504;Thanks to unique Japanese culture, their soldiers (bushi) were unable to admit defeat no matter the odds. In Army it resulted in tenacious defenses and 'Banzai' charges, making war with Imperial Army particularly bloody and long affair.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13500;Naval tactics and logistics continued to evolve as the war progressed.  New technologies whose development was spurred by the war were now entering into production.  This allowed for more efficient use of naval assets against the enemy.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13417;Thanks to unique Japanese culture, their soldiers (bushi) were unable to admit defeat no matter the odds. When situation on the front became grim, Japanese Navy reached for the most desperate way of fighting - suicide attacks, conducted by specially trained air and sea units. Historically, in late war period those attacks became prime threat for US Task Forces and took serious death toll among allied vessels.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13416;As the war progressed, it was discovered that submarines operating on the surface were being destroyed more frequently.  In order to combat these losses new tactics had to be developed.  These new tactics dictated that the submarines were to remain submerged as often as possible.  The technology available meant that the submarines couldn't remain submerged for long periods of time due to limitations imposed by the batteries.  New methods of propulsion need to be developed to allow the submarines to operate while submerged more effectively.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13415;During the course of the war better methods were developed for attacking enemy shores.  One of the main discoveries was that specialized equipment was a necessary ingredient for a successful attack.  There also needed to be a provision for increased command and control of the forces ashore.  During the initial assault, coordination of the forces ashore can more efficiently resist counterattacks by enemy forces.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13414;The increasing range of ASW aircraft meant that submarines were forced to make longer transits to their patrol locations.  This meant that fuel, provisions, and torpedoes became valuable commodities.  Specialized supply submarines were used to transfer the necessary supplies while at sea.  They had extra large coolers for stocking meat and vegetables, and specialized spaces for storing torpedoes.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13413;The supremacy of naval airpower meant that it was becoming more difficult for battleships to operate in their traditional role as anti-surface units.  That does not mean the end of this traditional role.  It does mean that battleships have to become more able to defend themselves against air attack and develop tactics to counter naval airpower.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13412;The supremacy of naval airpower meant that it was becoming more difficult for battleships to operate in their traditional role as anti-surface units.  The new role for the modern fast battleships was as AA screening ships for the fast carrier taskforces.  The great size and large reserve stability of the battleship made them ideal for holding the additional AA guns that were necessary for the role.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13411;Until the grouping of carriers into taskforces with multiple carriers, the presence of land based aircraft limited carriers to 'hit and run' raids.  The concentration of carrier aircraft meant that carriers could now stay to support amphibious assaults with tactical attacks on targets onshore.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13410;Control of the airspace over the fleet is important for the survival of the fleet in the face of attacks from land based and carrier based aircraft.  The use of a combat air patrol ensured that there were always aircraft aloft to defend the carrier from attack.  This also means that carrier based fighters would be used to establish air supremacy over an amphibious assault and provide protection from land based tactical bombers and fighters.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13409;The use of aircraft to hunt submarines was important for removing areas in which submarines were able to 'get lost' and hide from searching surface units.  This meant that the convoys could be covered farther from shore which reduced the time that they were vulnerable to submarine attack.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13408;The concentration of naval power at narrow points within the ocean is vital for maintaining control of the routes that the convoys are required to take.  Control of the choke points prevents easy access to the sea lanes by submarines and commerce raiders.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13400;As the war progressed, the tactics used by both sides continued to evolve.  The effectiveness of ASW escorts continued to improve as better equipment and tactics were devised.  The use of aircraft carriers also continued to evolve.  No longer were they limited to 'hit and run' tactics against land based aircraft.  They could come in and support amphibious operations and be confident that air superiority could be maintained in the face of concentrated airpower.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13311;The concentration of merchant shipping behind the defenses of the convoy escorts meant that new tactics had to be devised to combat this.  The concept was to concentrate the attack submarines to overwhelm the escorts and attack the convoy.  This system started with the sighting of the convoy by a single submarine.  The submarine would then radio the position of the convoy to shoreside command and serve as a homing beacon for other submarines.  The shoreside command would vector other submarines into position to attack the convoy in concert with other submarines.  This meant that multiple attacks were frequent and subs were able to cycle their attacks and then race on the surface to get into position to make another attack.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13310;In the wide reaches of the Pacific, established bases are few and far between.  This means that methods have to be developed that allow for the replenishment of fleet units in temporary bases that can be moved from location to location with the operations of the fleet.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13309;The first amphibious assaults of the war pointed out some deficiencies in the tactics and equipment that were in use at the time.  The need for specialized equipment was recognized as one of the immediate solutions to more effective amphibious operations.  Another problem was the coordination of the supporting naval forces and the troops ashore.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13308;The independent use of carriers started off with a single carrier working alone with some cruisers and destroyers, and evolved into multiple carriers operating together.  This allowed carriers to combine their air groups into a concentrated whole.  This will allow the carriers to operate within range of land based aircraft for an extended period of time and compete for control of the air.  This would also allow for more effective defense against attacks from other carriers, and attacks against other naval vessels.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13307;Destroyers are effective submarine hunters, but they often have more capability than is necessary for escorting convoys.  This means that a vessel that is specifically designed for ASW would be more effective.  These escorts are designed to be mass produced using parts and systems that aren't needed for units that make up the battleline.  This means that diesel engines and smaller main battery guns are used to conserve resources for destroyers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13306;It is often easier to continue to build the same design that is in production at the beginning of the war than to come up with a specialized design.  This allows for a large number of destroyers to be produced early in the war at the expense of designs specifically designed for ASW combat.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13305;The coastal trade is important for a nation's economy though the movement of goods internally.  These lines of trade are often overlooked when it comes to planning the defense of lines of commerce.  There are a large number of ships involved in this coastal trade which need to be integrated into the convoy system.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13304;As part of the tactics of concentrating the firepower of limited numbers of escorts, the concept of protecting focal points where traffic had to pass was developed.  By using the escorts in this fashion, the escorts are able to patrol areas where submarines and surface raiders are likely to attack because of concentrations of shipping.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13300;As the war developed, the navies involved had to remove any preconceptions about how the war was going to unfold.  The first surprise was the effectiveness of submarines against British shipping in the Atlantic.  The other lesson that was quickly learned was the ineffectiveness of surface warships in the face of land based air attacks.  All of these lessons had to be absorbed and counters developed.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13218;Naval battles fought at night are chaotic affairs.  Without reliable tactics and recognition signals, friendly fire incidents are a distinct possibility.  Special optics allow identification of targets with little available light.  Flashless powder means that enemy forces will be unable to counter fire at the flashes from the guns.  These tactics favor cruisers and destroyers because of their smaller profiles.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13217;The use of submarines to attack the enemy's commerce was shown to be very effective during the Great War.  This requirement means that tactics have to be developed to attack the convoys that are going to show up in the event of war.  Convoys mean that all of the merchant shipping is going to be concentrated into small areas where they will be easy to kill.  That is assuming that we are able to find those convoys.  The concentration of shipping also causes the concentration of the defending warships to counter attacks by submarines.  These attacks will require captains trained in overcoming the obstacles.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13216;The use of submarines to attack the enemy battlefleet can be considered the most important use for submarines during wartime.  This requires different tactics than attacking convoys of merchant ships.  Battlefleets move at speeds that make it difficult to get into attack position without using excessive battery power.  Battlefleets are also more heavily protected by destroyers than typical convoys.  All of these difficulties require captains that are trained in overcoming them.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13215;The use of cruisers to attack your enemy's commerce is a concept that goes back to before the Napoleonic Wars.  The concept had to be modernized in response to the effect of new technologies.  With the focus of cruiser design on commerce raiding, all cruiser designs have to be optimized to carry out this mission.  These commerce raiding cruisers can cruiser farther, but are more lightly armed and armored than their foreign counterparts used with the battlefleet.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13214;The ability to effectively land troops across an enemy shore gives additional options for the use of military power.  The ability to outflank your opponent allows our main attacks to be more effective.  It also allows us to attack enemy islands that are defended.  This will promote development of specialized equipment for use by our land forces.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13213;The decision to engage the enemy close to our bases with shore defenses or to engage them away from our shores is an important choice.  This doctrine believes that the most effective way to protect our bases is with fixed fortifications.  This will require the construction of defenses near all of our bases along the coast and provide enough troops to defeat any troops that might get ashore.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13212;The decision to engage the enemy close to our bases with shore defenses or to engage them away from our shores in an important choice.  This doctrine believes that it is important to engage the enemy as far from our shores as possible.  This will mean that our fleet will have to find and destroy the enemy at a distance.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13211;The refueling of naval units at sea is an operation which takes a lot of practice.  The breakthrough for underway replenishment was the adoption of oil fuel.  This meant that refueling could happen at sea which was impossible with coal.  To replenish at sea, the warship pulls up alongside the oiler while sailing on a parallel course approximately 10 yards (9 meters) apart.  The hose is passed from the oiler to the warship and fuel is pumped from one to the other.  This allows the range of the fleet to be extended where it can engage enemy ships farther from our bases.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13210;The difficulty with the standard carrier design was its inability to absorb damage from air and surface attacks.  The solution to this was an armored deck which supported the flight deck.  This deck would deflect bombs and shells and prevent damage.  The down side to this armor deck was the reduction in the size of the air group that could be carried on board.  Historically this was the carriers of the British Invisible-class.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13209;The development of the aircraft carrier meant that some decisions had to be made about their use within the fleet.  This doctrine believes that carriers will be more effective if their operations were independent from those of the battleline.  The carriers will make attacks upon the enemy fleet.  The use of airpower will devastate the enemy fleet before they can get into range of our fleet or carriers.  This will revolutionize naval combat.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13208;The development of the aircraft carrier meant that some decisions had to be made about their use within the fleet.  This doctrine believes that the role of the carrier is to support the battleships in the battleline.  The carriers will be used for scouting ahead of the battleline and insuring that the enemy will be brought to battle by slowing them down with air strikes.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13200;The time between the two world wars was a time of advancement and changes for the major maritime nations.  The root cause of most of the changes was the Washington Naval Limitation Treaty.  The treaty limited the number of battleships that each country was allowed to retain.  This meant that naval construction shifted to the construction of cruisers whose numbers weren't limited by the treaty.  This meant that the tactics used by these leaner, smaller fleets had to use had to evolve to cope with the new composition.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13113;The use of lighter than air craft for reconnaissance dates back to the late 19th century.  The United States Army first used simple tethered balloons to see enemy troop movements at a distance.  This was expanded during the Great War using rigidly framed airships used to scout for the battlefleet.  This increased the range of detection for the fleet and enabled them to engage more effectively.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13112;The use of submarines against maritime trade was hampered by the requirement that submarines would obey the Prize Laws.  The Prize Laws demanded that merchant ships as non-combatants had to be given warning and the opportunity to surrender.  This exposed the submarine to damage from guns on the merchant vessel.  In response, the submarines were given orders to attack without warning any vessel in the declared war zone.  This gave the stealthy submarine the advantage.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13111;The decision as to whether or not to blockade an enemy fleet close to their ports, or from a distant point determines how the fleet will operate.  A distant blockade will block off exits and confine the enemy to a region where they can do little damage.  The British used this tactic on the Germans during the Great War by confining the High Seas Fleet to the North Sea.  The battlefleet will then seek a decisive battle with the enemy.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13110;The decision as to whether or not to blockade an enemy fleet close to their ports, or from a distant point determines how the fleet will operate.  A close blockade requires cruisers and destroyers to remain off the enemy's ports and report when the enemy is preparing to sail, and keep them in port or allow battleships to engage.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13109;The use of convoys to combat submarines was resisted at first.  The British Admiralty thought that the difficulties of getting merchant vessels to operate in formation would be insurmountable.  That belief combined with the difficulties of coordinating the convoys delayed the implementation of convoys until forced by losses to begin the convoys.  Once implemented, convoys reduced the losses from submarine attacks by confining merchant ships to groups where they could be covered by escorts.  It also concentrated the escortís firepower where the targets were.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13108;This doctrine promotes the use of converted merchant ships for attacking and defending merchant ships.  Merchant ships are given medium caliber guns and naval crews for manning the new guns.  Once commissioned, their long range and innocent appearance helps to protect convoys and independent steamers.  Their innocent appearance also helps Auxiliary Cruisers when used in the commerce raiding role to get close to potential targets.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13107;This is experience in maneuvering large groups of battleships and cruisers in formation.  Operating in a line ahead formation that hails back to the days of Nelson, ships engage their opposite in the enemy battleline.  Destroyers and cruisers engage in fierce combat between the two lines of battleships.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13106;The development of the submarine but was limited to coastal defense due to the short range and lack of reliable sensors.  Once an effective submarine design was developed, submarines showed that they were able to affect naval combat.  Fleets all over the world are forced to deal with this 'underhanded' weapon that 'doesn't fight fair.'  There are still questions as to the proper use of submarines in combat which need to be resolved.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13105;The development of the aircraft carrier happened without much idea of how to use them in combat.  The carrier could be used for supporting the battlefleet with scouting or independent action against the enemy's fleet with aircraft.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13100;The Great War started many revolutions in naval combat.  This was the first war with large battles between modern steel warships.  The British Grand Fleet was able to keep the German High Seas Fleet contained within their ports and unable to affect the course of the war.  In the only battle between the Grand Fleet and the High Seas Fleet resulted in a draw as the Germans were able to sink 3 British battlecruisers, but were driven back into their ports where they would stay for the remainder of the war.  This war also saw the first extensive use of submarines in combat.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13019;Battleships are the heart of the battlefleet, but there are still many opinions as to what is more important in a battleship design.  This doctrine believes that survivability of the battleship is more important than the firepower or speed of the battleship.  This makes these battleships very difficult to sink compared to their foreign contemporaries.  It also means that they will take longer to complete due to the increased amount of construction that has to go into their hulls.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13018;Battleships are the heart of the battlefleet, but there are still many opinions as to what is more important in a battleship design.  This doctrine believes that speed is the most important feature of battleship design.  This allows for maneuvering the fleet to victory by cutting off your opponent and attacking parts of his fleet in detail.  This also allows for strategic options of cutting the enemy fleet off from their bases or engaging a fleeing opponent.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13017;Battleships are the heart of the battlefleet, but there are still many opinions as to what is more important in a battleship design.  This doctrine believes that the offensive hitting power of a battleship is the most important feature of battleship design.  This means that they will usually have larger, heavier guns than battleships in other fleets.  This makes their hitting power greater, but the difficulty of building those heavier guns also makes them more expensive then their foreign contemporaries.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13016;There are numerous uses for cruisers within the fleet.  This doctrine believes that cruisers are best used for attacking the enemy's lines of maritime trade.  This requires a cruiser that can stay at sea for a long period of time without supply.  These cruisers tend to be more lightly armed and armored than their counterparts that are used with the battlefleet because they are supposed to avoid combat with enemy warships.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13015;There are numerous uses for cruisers within the fleet.  This doctrine believes that cruisers are best used for scouting ahead of the battlefleet and preventing enemy scouts from doing their job effectively.  This requires a fast cruiser with good range to track enemy fleets and maneuver to counter enemy scouts.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13014;There are numerous uses for cruisers within the fleet.  This doctrine believes that cruisers are a valuable part of the battleline for their ability to add firepower at a smaller cost than their larger cousins the battleship.  This means that these cruisers need to be able to withstand more abuse than cruisers which are used for scouting or commerce raiding.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13013;This doctrine believes that large destroyers are a more valuable addition to the fleet because of their survivability in the face of enemy cruisers and destroyers.  This allows the destroyers to penetrate to torpedo range of the enemy battleships at the center of a formation.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13012;The use of destroyers in combat can go many directions.  This doctrine believes that destroyers are better used to defend the battlefleet against enemy scouts and destroyer attacks.  This means that the destroyers are better equipped for detecting enemy ships and submarines than destroyers that are primarily used for attacks against the enemy battlefleet.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13011;The use of destroyers in combat can go many directions.  This doctrine believes that destroyers are better used as weapons against an opposing battlefleet.  This means that the destroyers need to have more firepower than destroyers that are primarily used for screening the battlefleet from enemy scouts and destroyers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13010;The Admiralty is a central body that controls all aspects of the navy.  The Admiralty is responsible for determining of the requirements for the construction of later naval vessels.  They are also responsible for developing the strategies that will be used by the navy in future conflicts.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_1301;The 81mm+ Medium Mortar allowed an infantry unit to have access to longer-ranged, more powerful organic fire support than with the lighter 50mm+ Light Mortars. Historically, this was the German 8cm Granatwerfer 34, the American M1 81mm mortar, the British 3.4inch mortar, and the Japanese Type 97 81mm mortar.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13009;As naval warfare started to focus on maritime lines of communication, methods of defending those lines of communication have to be developed.  Once the war begins, all of our country's merchant shipping need to be brought under the control of the navy to ensure that ships are where they need to be, and that our shipping can be tracked from port to port.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13008;The concept of a war against your opponents maritime commerce is an old concept.  Using these concepts in the 20th century, Germany almost brought the British Empire to her knees during the Great War.  Modern concepts of commerce raiding emphasize the use of converted merchant ships, cruisers, and submarines.  The 'rules of war' dictate that commerce raiders stop a merchant vessel and insure that it is bound for a hostile nation and help the crew before sinking or claiming the vessel as a prize.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13007;Admiral Mahan wrote in the late 19th century that the key to a nation's success is control of the sea.  History showed that nations that controlled the oceans faired better on the world stage than nations with no naval strength.  The ancient Greeks, the Romans and the British Empire were all able to grow economically because of their naval domination of economic rivals.  This doctrine promotes the domination of the sea lanes through firepower embodied in battleships and cruisers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13000;These are the basic doctrines that are needed to field a navy that is able to fight effectively on the high seas.  The development of these basic doctrines will determine the types of missions that your warships will be able to accomplish through determining their design philosophy.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_1211;The 50mm+ Light Mortar allowed a small infantry sub-unit to carry its own organic indirect fire support replacing the rifle grenade. This could prove decisive in a sub-unit battle. Historically, this was the German 5cm Leichte Granatwerfer 36.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_1210;The Improved Light Machine Gun was as a development of the Great War Light Machine guns. They were more reliable and lighter and thereby better suited for modern motorized warfare than their Great War contemporaries. They become widely used and quite effective as the squad basic support weapon, replacing older models. Some of them used big magazines or drums that allowed sustained fire. Historically these were the Czechoslovakian ZB30, British Bren, Danish Madsen, Italian Breda 1930, Soviet DP 1928, Japanese Type 99 and French Chatellerault FM24/29.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_1209;The interwar period saw substantial theoretical development of the rifle. Many semi-automatic prototypes were developed, yet were too primitive and expensive for mass production. They formed a basis for later semi-automatic rifles. Historically this was the Belgian Modele 49;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_1204;The land mine saw wide-spread use during the Great War but was dangerous and cumbersome to adapt. This new generation of mines will effectively and quickly be put into use by the infantry and with great defensive value.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_1203;This weapon was designed to kill tanks but was only capable of penetrating lightly armored tankettes and scout cars. It was relatively light and easy to keep hidden so it was able to get within kill ranges easier than Anti-Tank Guns. Historically this was the British Boyes and German Panzerbuchse 39;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_1201;This rifle was the standard weapon of the infantryman and his primary armament. These weapons were highly accurate bolt action and were extremely useful defensive weapons yet were less effective on assaults. Historically this was the British Lee Enfield, German Mauser K98 and Russian Mosin-Nagant;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_12007;During the Great War all the air forces were true elites, grouping pre-war pilots and volunteers. Most of the time units pilots were officers only, and as a result whole pilot training process was long and costly. Usually, interwar recruitment/training methods were not as restrictive as those introduced in Great War, but in some countries training of pilots was still extreme elitist. While pilots trained this way had much skill, in case of loss their replacement was very hard. Historically this doctrine was introduced by Japan.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_12006;During the Great War all the air forces were true elites, grouping pre-war pilots and volunteers. Most of the time units pilots were officers only, and as a result whole pilot training process was long and costly. In interwar years many nations changed this practice and introduced mass training of their pilots, combined with lower criteria for candidates. While it enabled them to have a steady stream of pilots, their abilities were much lower and ultimately, losses were higher. Historically this kind of training was introduced in Soviet VVS (Vojenno Vozdushne Sily).;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_12005;While first attempts to use ship based planes in military operations took place during the Great War, vast effort was necessary to create carrier air groups. Ability to operate from small flight deck, navigate over the sea, coordinate work of the fuel/repair/armament teams was essential to create effective naval air force. Historically, in the middle of 1930s, only Great Britain, United States and Japan had sufficient experience to use carrier air groups effectively.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_11520;With the hard-earned experience of the Battle of France, it become obvious that the old static warfare doctrines were outdated and that this war was not going to be like the Great War at all. The French Army, specially the General Staff, had to completely reconsider its approach to modern warfare. This doctrine counters the negative modifiers of the Verd˙n Experience doctrine.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_11519;Polish military doctrine in the interwar period was mostly shaped by the experience of Bolshevik War of 1920-1921. As the result of that, light maneuverable units, able to operate in hard terrain conditions were assumed to carry most of the tasks in the further war, as it worked previously. Thanks to that, Poland developed cavalry units as elite, well armed 'mobile infantry', able to work both as offensive and elastic defensive force, and development of motorized units was seriously slowed.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_11518;In late 1930s, concept of battlefield role of the tanks dramatically changed. While up to date tanks were mainly anti-infantry weapon, designed to support infantry in the assaults, new doctrines gave tanks role of the operational scale weapons. New tasks required new approach to the organization of armored units and tank designs.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_11517;Unlike their German counterparts, the Elite Units of the Italian Army were rarely deployed together in numbers. Instead, small formations of Elite Units (like the motivated Black Brigades and motorized Bersiglari light infantry groups) were deployed under each division of the Italian Army, this was known as corseting and it was thought that such a practice would make up for the failings of many units. Other specialized divisions, like the MVSN Anti-Partisan Groups, were deployed behind the front to guard supply lines and maintain order in occupied areas.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_11516;The Italian government began revamping the Army after the early failures in the war. Using artillery and vehicles confiscated from countries they had occupied, the Italians eventually had the equipment they needed to wage a modern war. Also, reorganization of the Comando Supremo made up for many of the faults in the command structure. Historically, these changes came too late to save Fascist Italy. The government crumbled as the Allies began a massive invasion of mainland Italy.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_11515;On paper Italy had a large and fairly well equipped army. However, it lacked many of the basic requirements for modern war.  Firstly, there was an incredible shortage of artillery, and the artillery that was there consisted mainly of modernized ex-Austrian pieces taken in war reparations after the first world war (each piece being, on average, about 40 years old).  Secondly, armored units depended heavily on tankettes to fatten out their ranks, these smaller vehicles proved to have insufficient armor to withstand even machine gun fire.  Thirdly, the Italian army was made up of a binary divisional system, each division only having roughly 66% the strength of any of Italy's European contemporaries.  Lastly, and perhaps most devastatingly, the Italian leadership was incredibly disorganized, the branches of the Armed Forces failing to act in concert or singly in any coherent manner.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_11514;As Otto von Bismarck said, 'Russia is never as strong as it looks. It's never as weak as it looks either'. As WW II showed, Red Army, when rightly motivated, was able to fight successfully even in totally extreme conditions, like in winter of 1941, or without proper equipment, like during crossing the Dnieper. With the end of war, industry can return to less intensive production.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_11513;After the Great War was lost and their colonial and European empires divided by victorious Allies, German war planners started the process of analyzing the conflict. As the losing side, Germany were interested in recreating pre-war order and their war theories were much more targeted on aggressive warfare than any other European power. In effect, Germany were the first of countries fully implementing the idea of an offensive based on the attack of fast mechanized and tank units, supported by tactical and dive bombers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_11512;As Otto von Bismarck said, 'Russia is never as strong as it looks. It's never as weak as it looks either'. As WW II showed, Red Army, when rightly motivated, was able to fight successfully even in totally extreme conditions, like in winter of 1941, or without proper equipment, like during crossing the Dnieper.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_11511;During World War II and later, guerilla warfare was a common way of fighting against technologically superior enemy. Attacks on the supply lines, outposts, sabotage as well as intelligence information created serious distraction behind enemy lines. Regular armies answered this threat by anti-partisan sweeps, but every operation of this kind was both supply and time expensive.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_11510;Special forces are highly trained in extensive variety of skills in addition to being heavily cross-trained in other job areas. SF troops are highly trained in unconventional-warfare operations and special secret missions. They not only provided Elite fighting units, but also troops whose main job was training potential partisans in the art of guerrilla warfare.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_11509;Resistance organizations, saboteurs, guerillas, commandos and agents behind enemy lines could provide vital information, thus supporting army operations.  These improvised units were the forerunners to Special Forces and intelligence agencies such as the CIA and the KGB.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_11508;French army suffered great losses during Great War and memories of this conflict shaped french military doctrine for the next 20 years. The next war was intended to become another trench war and no new ways of fighting were needed.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_11507;Soviet Army was under constant control of communist party to prevent any possible coup attempts - commissars were put on every level in chain of command. In result, Red Army seriously lacked initiative since every decision of commander could be questioned by his political advisor.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_11506;As the war ground on and manpower became more scarce, Staff officers devised a new divisional structure that would retain the firepower of the older division, while reducing the number of personnel by 25 percent by increasing the number of automatic weapons and other support weapons in the division. Historically, these were the German 1944 Divisions.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_11505;Fighting in subzero temperatures requires specialized training, equipment, and methods to be effective. Not all armies had this experience in World War II at first, but many of them proved to be quick learners, especially the German Army.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_11504;So-called 'Elite' units had been found to be of great use in the Great War. These units were more expensive and needed more manpower, due to their stringent physical and mental requirements, but had more esprit de corps than normal units and were capable of fighting long after a normal unit would have been destroyed. Historically, these were the German Waffen-SS.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10981;The first supersonic fighters entered service in the mid 1950s, and they were the F-100 Super Sabre in the United States, and the Russian MiG-19. They had a top speed of 1500+ km/h and a range of 2200 kilometers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10980;Despite serious progress on the engine field, breaching the sound barrier was still the major problem. New planes, designed to fly with speeds higher than sound needed long tests to work in new, extreme conditions.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10979;The first post-war jet fighters in many countries, from the Soviet Union to Argentina, and to a lesser extent, the United States, were very heavily based off of German designs. One such example was the Russian MiG-15, which had a top speed of 1100+ km/h and an operational range of 1850 km.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10978;New generations of turbojet planes were even more oriented on high speed flight. Aerodynamics of those designs was extremely advanced, compared to the earlier planes. New, more efficient engines allowed those planes to achieve new records of acceleration, altitude and climb rate. The sound barrier was almost within reach.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10977;Early drop tanks were made out of wood and suffered from many problems such as leakage, poor release mechanism and increased drag.  It still allowed aircraft a valuable increase in effective range and time over target, with a promise of even better capabilities as the technology is refined further.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10944;The second generation of turbojet fighters had improved engines and had completely new airframes designed to take advantage of the turbojet engine. They had top speeds of 865+ km/h and ranges of 1050 km. Historically, these were the American P-80 Shooting Star and the German Me-262A.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10943;First tests of turbojet planes allowed engineers to gain enough experience to create new generation of those. New planes were much more reliable, fuel efficient, and various systems were created to deal with new conditions of super-fast flight.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10942;The flaws of the first rocket fighters were absurdly low operational ranges. This version had double the range of the earlier rocket fighters, and a slightly higher top speed. Historically, this was the German Me-263, with a top speed of 1000 km/h and a range of 250 km.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10941;First tests of rocket planes allowed engineers to gain enough experience to create new generation of rocket propulsion. While still suffering from main weakness of rocket propulsion (fuel inefficiency), those planes were much more reliable then the earlier 'flying bombs'.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10911;Airframes designed to work in the conditions of supersonic speeds were extremely advanced. Ability to work in extremely high temperatures, and withstand high pressure and acceleration allowed the construction of new generations of fighters. ;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10910;After many attempts to solve the problem of reaching supersonic speed, concept of afterburner was created. While very effective in accelerating the plane, afterburners were also extremely fuel-inefficient, so time of their use was rather limited.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10909;As aerodynamics of the planes improved, bigger and more advanced wind tunnels were constructed. Thanks to the improved testing, development of more advanced planes become possible.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10908;New generations of G-suits were much more suited for sub-sonic speeds of the new turbojet planes. The importance of those become even more obvious when planes breached the sound barrier.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10906;As the 1950s started, the first jet fighters designed specifically to achieve supersonic speeds in level flight emerged in both the United States and the Soviet Union. They would need extensive testing before they could be accepted for squadron service.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10905;Some of the ideas put forth in German aircraft laboratories in the late war period were radical and far-reaching in concept and design. It took many years for these ideas to be analyzed and then applied to production fighters.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10818;The Improved Ground Attack 2-engined Fighter was heavily modified version of original 'destroyer planes'. Although optimized for the ground attacks it also possessed limited air-to-air ability, allowing it to operate independently, without fighter cover. Historically, this was the British Beaufighter Mk.XI.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10817;Prototype stage of the development allows constructors to find early faults of the construction and deal with them before mass production takes place.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10816;The Advanced Escort 2-engined Fighter was the last generation of 'destroyers'. With new engines, powerful weaponry and decent range, those planes were used as night fighters and specialized recon planes. Historically, this was the American P-61 'Black Widow'.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10815;Prototype stage of the development allows constructors to find early faults of the construction and deal with them before mass production takes place.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10814;The Advanced Multi-Role Fighter was heavy fighter optimized for fighting on the low altitude with option to carry limited air-to-surface armament. Historically, this was the American P-47N 'Thunderbolt'.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10813;Prototype stage of the development allows constructors to find early faults of the construction and deal with them before mass production takes place.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10812;The Advanced Air Superiority Fighter was the best of one-engine fighters - fast plane equipped with powerful engine and best armament available. Historically, this was the British Spitfire Mk. XIV.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10811;Prototype stage of the development allows constructors to find early faults of the construction and deal with them before mass production takes place.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10809;While original 'destroyer fighter' idea was long abandoned, Twin Engine Fighters were still developed as specialized planes - night fighters and heavy support planes. Not as effective in standard fight as their one-engine counterparts, those planes had still some aces in their sleeves - heavy armament and long range among them.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10808;The Advanced Long Range Fighter was light aircraft designed to escort bombers far into the enemy territory and create defensive 'cover' for them. Historically, this was the American P-51D 'Mustang'.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10807;Advanced Light Single Engine Fighters were best conventionally propelled fighters. Extremely fast, able to fight both on low and high altitudes, those planes were the last word of pre-turbojet era.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10806;The first turbojet fighters were based off slightly modified conventional airframes, but they managed to outrun even the most advanced piston-engine fighters of the time. They had speeds of 817+ km/h and ranges of only 600 km. Historically, these were the American P-59A Airacobra and the German He-280.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10805;Work on the rocket propulsion was supported by the experiments on turbojet engine. While not as extreme in power as rocket, turbojet engine was much more effective when it come to fuel use. Early experiments on the turbojet engines allowed the creation of the first projects for turbojet fighters.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10804;The Basic Rocket Fighter was for a time, the fastest thing in the air, but at the cost of minuscule range. Typically, these planes had speeds of 960+ km/h but ranges of only 125 km. Historically, this was the German Me-163B Komet.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10803;During the late 1930s, many nations were experimenting with small rocket engines. While those early works were not able to support manned vehicles, wide tests allowed them to prepare the basic concept of the new generation of fighter - propelled by the rocket engine, and using 'hit and run' tactics thanks to the superior speed.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10802;The Advanced Interceptor was a light, highly maneuverable aircraft designed to shoot down other aircraft in air-to-air combat, with speeds generally around 750+ km/h and ranges of 1000+ km. Historically, this was the German Me-109K 'Kurfurst'.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10801;Advanced Light Single Engine Fighters were highly developed designs, based on the experiences gained during the conflict. Fast, agile and well armed, those planes were the best machines for low-altitude dogfight.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10708;At the late stages of war it become obvious, that gun armament mounted in the chassis of planes might not be enough to fight armored targets. Various attempts to solve this problem resulted in designing gun pods - attachable and easy in maintenance. Historically, those were 37mm gun pods of Ju-87G.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10707;One of the smaller achievements of jet/rocket planes program was rocket booster - small rocket engine attached to the conventional planes. Thanks to the faster rate of climb and rapid acceleration, fighter planes received ability to intercept their targets faster, although due to the low fuel supply this bonus was rather short-lived.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10706;As aerodynamics of the planes improved, bigger and more advanced wind tunnels were constructed. Thanks to the improved testing, development of advanced planes become possible.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10516;The Improved Ground Attack 2-engined Fighter was heavily modified version of original 'destroyer planes'. Optimized for the ground attacks, it also possessed a limited air-to-air ability, allowing it to operate independently, without fighter cover. Historically, this was the German Bf-110G.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10515;Prototype stage of the development allows constructors to find early faults of the construction and deal with them before mass production takes place.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10514;The Improved Escort 2-engined Fighter was the next generation of original 'destroyer plane'. With new engines, powerful weaponry and decent range, those planes were used as night fighters and specialized recon planes. Historically, this was the British 'Mosquito'.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10513;Prototype stage of the development allows constructors to find early faults of the construction and deal with them before mass production takes place.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10512;The Improved Multi-Role Fighter was heavy fighter optimized for fighting on the low altitude with option to carry limited air-to-surface armament. Historically, this was the British Hawker 'Typhoon'.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10511;Prototype stage of the development allows constructors to find early faults of the construction and deal with them before mass production takes place.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10510;The Improved Air Superiority Fighter was a heavy, fast plane equipped with powerful engine and best armament available. While not as easy to manufacture as light fighters, it was much more effective when it come to the fight in high altitudes. Historically, this was the German Fw-190A 'Butcher Bird' and the American F4U 'Corsair'.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10509;Prototype stage of the development allows constructors to find early faults of the construction and deal with them before mass production takes place.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10508;The Improved LR Fighter was generally a modified light fighter able to reach distant targets thanks to the bigger fuel tanks as well as generally lighter construction. Speeds were generally around 650+ km/h and ranges of 700+ km. Historically, this was American F6F Hellcat.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10507;Prototype stage of the development allows constructors to find early faults of the construction and deal with them before mass production takes place.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10506;Concept of 'destroyer plane' - tough, heavily armed plane, able to act both as the escort for bombers and ground attack plane proved to be wrong - while those planes were effective against older planes, for the new generations of fighters would be 'destroyers' were simply a prey. New planes of this line were designed either as night fighters, or as specialized close support planes.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10505;Prototype stage of the development allows constructors to find early faults of the construction and deal with them before mass production takes place.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10504;Early Medium Single Engine Fighters proved to be very effective, both in fighting heavy bombers and in classic dogfight. Due to the high costs of construction those planes were never able to fully replace light fighters, but were used for the goals that light fighter could not achieve. New generation of those planes, fitted with better engines and armament was the best air-to-air weapon up to date.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10503;Prototype stage of the development allows constructors to find early faults of the construction and deal with them before mass production takes place.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10502;Early Light Single Engine Fighters proved to be good planes, but somehow not too effective in fighting at the high altitudes. Consequently, this task was left for heavier air-superiority fighters, while light fighters were optimized for fighting on low altitudes - as so called 'front fighters'.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10404;Early G-suits allowed pilots to withstand serious acceleration and deceleration, thus making them able to use new tactics based on more extreme maneuvers. Historically, those were first used in Royal Air Force.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10311;Drop-shaped Glass proved to be great improvement for fighters - it granted pilots better view (very important in pre-radar era), as well as improved whole aerodynamics of the construction. Historically, this design was used on German Fw-190A 'Butcher Bird'.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10310;As another defensive application, self-sealing tanks allowed pilots in damaged planes to return safely home. The specially designed tank sealed itself thanks to rubberized elements of it's cover.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10309;While fighter planes could not be seriously armored due to the serious loss on the speed, acceleration and the climb rate, limited armor was sometimes applied. Usually that was armor plate behind pilot seat. Historically, those armor plates were fitted in American P-40 Warhawks and F-4 Wildcats.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10308;While early on-board radios proved to be extremely unreliable, new generations of those allowed planes to coordinate their operations much better. Ability to contact with all the squadron members, as well as support of land based personnel resulted in more effective work of large formations of planes.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10307;Additional equipment, like sand filters in North Africa, ski landing gear in Karelia, proved to be very useful when it came to fighting in zones with extreme climate conditions.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10305;Prototype stage of the development allows constructors to find early faults of the construction and deal with them before mass production takes place.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10301;Prototype stage of the development allows constructors to find early faults of the construction and deal with them before mass production takes place.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10206;The Improved Interceptor was a light, highly maneuverable aircraft designed to shoot down other aircraft in air-to-air combat, with speeds generally around 650+ km/h and ranges of 500+ km. Historically, this was the American F6F Hellcat.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10205;Prototype stage of the development allows constructors to find early faults of the construction and deal with them before mass production takes place.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10204;Prototype stage of the development allows constructors to find early faults of the construction and deal with them before mass production takes place.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10112;The Basic Ground Attack 2-engined Fighter was the modification of original 'destroyer plane'. While destroyers proved to be not that effective as fighters, their ground attack ability granted them a new combat role. Historically, this was the German Bf-110B Zerstoerer.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10111;Prototype stage of the development allows constructors to find early faults of the construction and deal with them before mass production takes place.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10110;The Basic Twin Engine Escort Fighter was typically an aircraft originally designed to escort bombers to their targets and back. As a result, it had unsurpassed range, generally in excess of 600+ km. Speeds were in excess of 490+ km/h. Historically, this was the German Bf-110C Zerstoerer.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10109;Prototype stage of the development allows constructors to find early faults of the construction and deal with them before mass production takes place.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10108;The Basic Multi-Role Fighter was a heavy plane equipped with a powerful engine and best armament, with option to carry some air-to-surface armament. Historically, this was the Italian Fiat G.50 Freccia.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10107;Prototype stage of the development allows constructors to find early faults of the construction and deal with them before mass production takes place.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10106;The Basic Air Superiority Fighter was a heavy, fast plane equipped with a powerful engine and best armament available. While not as easy to manufacture as light fighters, it was the best deal when it came to dogfight. Historically, this was the German Bf-109F 'Fritz'.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10105;Twin engine fighter development was based on the concept of 'destroyer plane' - tough, heavily armed plane, able to act both as the escort for bombers and ground attack plane. This concept, very popular in the middle of 1930s, resulted in various designs in almost all countries with an airplane industry.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10104;The Basic LR Fighter was a light, highly maneuverable aircraft modified to reach distant targets as the bomber escort. With better range other parameters of the plane were usually reduced, and it was extremely rare to find a successful design of this kind of plane. Historically, this was the Japan A6M2 Zeke (Zero).;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10103;Basic concept of the fighter plane was born over the trenches of the Great War. Constant development of the air technologies allowed the construction of much more sturdy planes, fitted with powerful engines and best armament available. Main features of those planes were great climb rates and devastating firepower. Later those planes separated into two main groups - air-superiority fighter and fighter-bomber.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10102;The Basic Interceptor was a light, highly maneuverable aircraft designed to shoot down other aircraft in air-to-air combat, with speeds generally around 500+ km/h and ranges of 300+ km. Historically, this was the German Bf-109D.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10101;Basic concept of the fighter plane was born over the trenches of the Great War. While early tasks of those planes were mainly chasing off scout planes and shooting down balloons, principles of the fighter combat were soon developed. Based on those were light fighters - agile, fast, but not able to withstand heavy punishment. Later those planes separated into two main groups - interceptor and long range fighter.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_1004;The Grenade was developed during the Great War as a portable explosive weapon capable of flushing out troops in underground bunkers and pillboxes;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10030;The helicopters that had been developed needed to be modified to be operated at sea.  Some of these modifications included weatherproofing and making the helicopters easy to move on deck.  Weatherproofing was necessary because of the corrosive salt air that was present onboard naval ships, so parts that could rust or corrode had to be replaced or protected.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_1003;The Light Machine Gun was first developed during the Great War as a portable Machine Gun capable of supporting trench assaults. Historically these were the British Lewis, American Browning Automatic Rifle and French Chauchat;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_1002;The Great War Flamethrower needed a crew of combat engineers to handle. Its purpose was to root out the enemy from a cellar or a bunker;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10012;New supersonic fighters were very efficient in providing support for close and middle range bomber missions, but long range missions were a whole different matter. While covering bombers on the first stage of approach, those planes were unable to cover whole distance of bombing run.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10011;Advanced turbojet fighters, with much better engines and fuel efficiency were able to provide better support for close and medium range bomber missions.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10010;New generations of turbojet fighters were able to provide serious support for close range missions, but were unable to support long range bombers on their way to the target.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_1001;The Rifle Grenade was first developed during the Great War but was refined during the interwar period which gave infantry increased range and increased utility;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10009;Advanced fighter planes usually were able to support heavy bombers on the whole distance of the bombing raid, effectively creating strong air cover, very hard to penetrate for intercepting fighters.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10008;New generation of fighter planes could create a better escort for heavy bomber planes, covering much longer distance and being able to give decent fight to the intercepting planes.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10007;Basic generation of fighter planes allowed them to create flexible escort teams, supporting heavier bomber planes on the way to target. While quite effective when it come to the close range tasks, fighters usually failed to cover whole distance of the long range missions.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10006;Prototype stage of the development allows constructors to find early faults of the construction and deal with them before mass production takes place.;;;;;;;;;;X

CRO;Croatia;;;;;;;;;;X
CRO_DESC;After a democratic coup the fate of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was sealed as Hitler had decided to eliminate it from map of Europe. It was quickly agreed to divide large part of Yugoslavian territory amongst its neighbors: Germany, Italy, Hungary and Bulgaria. Serbia would come under German and Bulgarian occupation leaving only Croatia and Bosnia & Herzegovina as undecided since neither Italy nor Hungary wanted to take control of such large area with hostile population. German hopes of creating puppet under the leadership of the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS) and current Yugoslav vice-premier Vladko Macek, thus insuring loyalty of population, failed after Macek refused twice to discuss anything with Nazi regime. An alternative was found in Ante Pavelic, leader of the prewar terrorist organization Ustashe, which was supported by Mussolini's fascist Italy in hopes of destabilizing the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Things moved quickly from there on as on the same day German tanks entered Zagreb. The Ustasha leader, former Austro-Hungarian colonel Slavko Kvaternik proclaimed the independent state of Croatia, Ustashe agents across Croatia and Bosnia & Herzegovina attempted to destabilize country and carry out coups in cities and military units. Kvaternik's own brother Milutin was arrested and shot in one such coup attempted in Crikvenica. Ante Pavelic left Italy for Zagreb and arrived on April 15th and immediately took over role of Poglavnik, leader, and formed the first government. The initial popularity of the new independent state quickly disappeared as Ustashe regime showed its true nature, repression and implementation of German style racial laws forced many to join resistance which quickly grew in strength to one of the strongest in Europe.;;;;;;;;;;X

COS_DESC;Costa Rica differed in several ways from other countries in Middle America. Because of the largely white population there were no racial conflicts. Farming was dominated by family businesses owned by a broad middle class offering little fuel for a clash of social interests. Politically, however, influential and rivaling families called the tune and even resorted to military action to achieve their goals. Sugar and coffee were important export goods, but bananas were the most important one for which a tight railroad was built, improving the economical growth of Costa Rica. The banana production came slowly under complete control of U.S. businesses (among others United Fruit). Parallel to this, Costa Rica witnessed a calm democratic development with presidents elected in constitutional elections. This period was only interrupted by the short dictatorship of Frederico Tinoco Granodos (1917 - 1919).;;;;;;;;;;X

COL_DESC;Weakened by civil wars (especially 1899 - 1903), Colombia had to acknowledge U.S. rights of control of the Panama Canal in the Hay-Bunan-Varilla Treaty of 1903, ending the conflict between the two countries about the building of the Canal. When the Colombian Congress refused to ratify the treaty, the United States forced the secession of Panama from Colombia, compensating them between 1921 and 1930 with a payment of a total $25 million. Colombia formally recognized Panama in 1921. The conservatives pursued the modernization of the country, expanding the railroad network. Since 1850 Colombia had been exporting tobacco, after 1900 coffee and bananas were added (with the aid of U.S. capital), and after 1905 petroleum. The Great Depression brought the liberals into government in 1930 who enacted a land reform, dispossessing big landowners, and social reforms, easing the consequences of the economic crisis for the middle class, the workers' class and the peasants.;;;;;;;;;;X

CHL_DESC;After the Saltpeter War (1879 - 1883) in which Chile received the Peruvian saltpeter provinces Tarapac· and Arica in addition to the Bolivian coastal region of Antofagasta the country had command over vast copper deposits and monopolized the world trade in saltpeter. A phase of economic prosperity was initiated, supported by the high demand for saltpeter at the beginning of World War One. However, the chemical processes devised during that war to artificially produce saltpeter rendered Chile's deposits worthless. Worsening economic circumstances, together with the growth of the population increased social crisis. Workers and unions gained political influence. President Arturo Alessandri y Palma (1920 -1925, 1932 - 1938) tried to overcome the social tensions. A new constitution expanded the president's powers at the cost of the congress' authority. After the military dictatorship of Carlos Ibanez del Campo (1927 -1931) fell under the pressure of the Great Depression the country slowly recovered from the recession.;;;;;;;;;;X

CHI_DESC;The early 1930s were both good times and bad times for Nationalist China. On the one hand, the Guomindang regime under Chiang Kai-Shek was at the peak of it's power, having driven Mao Tse-tung's Communists on their grueling 6000 mile march to Shaanxi and established themselves as the most powerful force in Chinese politics. It seemed that China was at last united under a stable, modernizing regime, ready to bring the country into the 20th century after years of humiliation at the hands of stronger countries. However, it faced a severe challenge: an increasingly belligerent and imperialist Japan desiring to expand it's resource base at China's expense. Having already conceded control of Manchuria to the Japanese in 1931, China seems destined for further clashes with the island nation, yet in early 1936 Chiang shows no signs of letting up in his civil war against the Communists. The question China must now face is a sore one: when and if Japan continues her expansion, will the Nationalists fight, or will China be humiliated yet again?;;;;;;;;;;X

EGY_DESC;In the nineteenth century Egypt became a self-governing province of the Ottoman Empire under the leadership of the heirs of Muhammad Ali an Albanian Muslim general who helped liberate Egypt from Napoleon and established himself as Khedive. Under Muhammad Ali and his heirs Egypt began to integrate itself into the Western world economy culminating in the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. But Westernization came at a cost of greater Western influence in Egypt and in 1882 an attempt to end Western influence and the rule of the khedives was launched by Colonel Ahmad Urabi and led to British military occupation. While technically still an Ottoman province Egypt became a British protectorate under the khedives who were dominated by the British advisors sent to help them continue to 'modernize.' After 1882 Egypt became the cultural center of the Arab world and a lively press developed that promoted various causes to help the Egyptians improve their position with the West leading to a rise in nationalism. With the outbreak of war in 1914 Brtain severed the Ottoman connection to Egypt and took over direct rule causing much anger among educated Egyptians. In 1919 Egyptian nationalists tried to send a delegation or Wafd to Versailles in an attempt to gain support for ending British domination of Egypt. When the British refused to let the Wafd into the conference revolt broke out that led the British to rethink their position. In 1922 Egypt was declared a kingdom but with the British still controlling many areas of Egyptian public life. The Wafd leadership under Sa'd Zaghlul and later Mustafa Nahhas demanded full independence and parliamentary control of the state. King Fu'ad also wanted an independent Egypt but under his - not the Wafd's - control so that the 1920s and 1930s would witness a three-way struggle for power in Egypt between king Wafd and the British that would last until Fu'ad's death in 1936. As the international situation deteriorated in the mid-1930s Britain hoped to settle conditions and after Fu'ad's death reached an agreement with the Wafd that gave Egypt control over most areas of public life with the exceptions of control over the Suez Canal and the Western desert joint control over the Sudan (seen by Egyptian nationalists as vital for its control of the Nile River) and British rights to military access. While not all Egyptian nationalists were happy Nahhas accepted the agreement and in 1936 Egypt entered the League of Nations. In the background however was the new king 17-year old Faruq who despised Nahhas and hoped to regain the power his father had enjoyed before his death. With new elections due in 1937 when Faruq came of age the question of who would lead Egypt - the Wafd or the king - remained very much in doubt and the continuing influence of Britain in Egyptian life remained a sore point for many.;;;;;;;;;;X
LEB_DESC;Homeland of the ancient Phoenicians the region that would become modern Lebanon came under Ottoman Turkish rule in 1516. As religiously diverse as it is in terms of its geography by the mid-nineteenth century tensions between the Maronites an Arab Christian community that recognized Papal supremacy Sunni and Shi'a Muslims and the Druze would explode in intercommunity conflict in 1860. France hoping to expand its influence in the Levant and claiming to be the protector of 'Latin' Christians in the Ottoman territories pressured the Ottoman state to grant Lebanon self-government under local Maronite leaders leading to the creation of Mount Lebanon sanjak around Beirut in which the French wielded strong influence. Self-government would lead to Beirut's rise as a major commercial port and raise the influence of the Maronites within Lebanon. Prosperity and French influence also brought increased interest in Western political economic and social ideas and the relative freedom of the territory allowed Beirut to become the second center of Arab nationalism after Cairo. World War I would end this era of prosperity as the sanjak was put back under the direct rule of the Ottoman governor of Syria based in Damascus and repression against Maronite leaders seen as pro-French was instituted. Per the secret Anglo-French Sykes-Picot agreement the defeat of the Ottomans in World War I would see Lebanon fall into the French sphere of influence in the Arab world. The French would quickly come to see the Maronites as their strongest allies in the region leading to the separation of Mount Lebanon and a large stretch of predominantly Muslim territory from Syria into a separate mandate of Grand Lebanon in 1924. The borders were drawn so as to ensure the maximum amount of territory for the new state but retaining a majority Christian population something that was supported by Maronites but resented by Muslims and Druze - who would have preferred to remain in Syria - as well as non-Maronite Christian communities. By terms of the mandate France was obliged to prepare Lebanon for eventual self-government and independence a goal that many in France (and some Maronites) hoped to stretch out indefinitely while most Muslims and Druze and many Christians demanded be achieved rapidly. After serious strikes in 1925 the French would grant a constitution creating a Lebanese republic in which positions of power in the state were divided along confessional lines with the Maronites in dominant postions and with the French retaining huge amounts of authority in all areas of public life. For the next ten years Lebanese politics would revolve around negotiations with the French to create a more balanced political system to represent Lebanon's religious reality the effort to reduce direct French oversight over Lebanese affairs and struggles among the elite of Maronite society to control what power the Lebanese were granted. The establishment of a treaty between Britain and Iraq ending the mandate there in 1932 added further impetus to change and in 1936 a new treaty modeled on the Iraqi formula was negotiated between the French and Lebanese which pleased most of the Maronite leadership and key members of the Sunni Muslim Shi'i Muslim and Druze leadership. However many Muslims still preferred the idea of reunion with Syria many on the right in France saw the treaty as a dangerous loss of French influence in the region at a time of growing tensions in Europe and even some Maronites felt the new parliamentary system was not the best solution to protect their interests looking for alternatives in quasi-fascist movements such as the al-Kata'ib (Phalange) recently established by Pierre Jumayyil. Whether the 1936 Agreement would be a viable route to complete France's mandate responsibilities thus remained an open question.;;;;;;;;;;X
SYR_DESC;Conquered by the Ottomans in 1516 the lands that would become modern Syria consisted of parts of the Ottoman vilayets of Damascus and Aleppo. As the Ottomans undertook a modernization program in the nineteenth century in an attempt to preserve the Empire's territorial integrity and increase the authority of Istanbul over the provinces new Western ideas about politics society and the economy began to filter into the region along with increasing Western economic penetration challenging the traditional authority of local Arab Sunni Muslim elites. As the Young Turks undertook a program of Turkification after 1908 for the Ottoman Empire's elites the local elites of Syria began to turn to Arabism with some hoping to transform the Ottoman state into a Turkish-Arab Dual Empire that would preserve their traditional influence and a few even calling for independence. Severe repression by the Young Turks of these Arabists combined with the strains of World War I would lead to the conquest of Syria by the forces of the Arab Revolt in 1918. Having been promised the leadership of an independent Arab state in exchange for leading revolt against the Ottomans Sharif Husayn's son Faysal moved in 1919 to declare himself ruler of Syria based in Damascus. A secret arrangement between Britain and France to divide the Arab possessions of the Ottomans the Sykes-Picot Agreement placed Syria in the French sphere and they soon demanded Faysal recognize French overlordship. When Faysal refused the French invaded Syria and drove Faysal out in 1920. From ten on the French would have to contend with Muslim Syrian hostility to their control of the League of Nations mandate. To meet this challenge the French attempted to divide Syria into smaller states in which minority groups would dominate - successfully implemented in the creation of Lebanon in 1924 and also used to grant limited autonomy to the 'Alawi of the Syrian coast the Druze in the Mountains southwest of Damascus and the Kurds east of the Euphrates River. This did little to gain the French support of most of the majority Muslims of Syria and in 1925 revolt would again threaten French power leading to complaints in the League of Nations that France was not fulfilling its Mandate responsibilities. By 1927 the Revolts would be crushed and in 1930 the French would attempt to create an 'independent' republic in which minority groups preserved much autonomy and the French retained a dominant position. The majority Muslim communities rejected this solution and continued to agitate for greater control something which had been gained by Iraq in 1932 from the British. In 1936 following a further outbreak of riots across Syria the French would sign an agreement granting Syria much more control over its own affairs and ending the local autonomy enjoyed by minority areas gaining the support of some key members of the Sunni Muslim elite in Damascus and Aleppo. Yet the 1936 treaty faced many challenges. Some radical Syrian Muslim nationalists led by Dr 'Abd al-Rahman Shahbandar rejected it as too little demanding full independence the reunification of Lebanon with Syria and the withdrawal of French troops. The 'Alawi and Druze communities resented the restoration of Sunni Muslim dominance and demanded the restoration of local self-rule while the Turks in Alexandretta (al-skandariyya Hatay) demanded reunion with Turkey. And many on the French right vowed to fight the passage of the treaty by the French Chamber of Deputies arguing it reduced France's power in a key region at a time of growing threats in Continental Europe. Whether the 1936 Treaty was to become the basis of France's fulfillment of its mandate responsibilities seemed very much an open question.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_322429;Germany's reoccupation of the Rhineland triggers a massive war scare.  The French have mobilized their army and are preparing for war unless the Germans withdraw.  This French 'bullying' of the Germans is not popular in the USA and creates an element of sympathy for Germans.  However, members of Congress see this as an opportunity to cut military expenditures since the French are doing such a good job of keeping Germany in line.;;;;;;;;;;X 
CEVTNAME_322430;Japan Conquers and Garrisons China;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_322430;Japan has conquered China and is deploying massive numbers of troops as a permanent garrison for the country.  The president is furious that the 'Open Door' policy has been reduced to tatters by this Japanese aggrandizement.  The Japanese ambassador has been lectured that this action is unacceptable and the US ambassador to Japan has been recalled for consultations.  The War Department delivers a mixed verdict on this action.  While the Japanese will be strengthened by access to raw materials, especially coal and tungsten, the vast numbers of Chinese to be policed will put a heavy burden on the Japanese Army.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_322472;America First organizer and aviator Charles Lindbergh addresses a crowd of 8,000 Iowans in the Des Moines Coliseum on 11 September 1941.  He accuses the Roosevelt Administration and special interest groups of wanting to involve the USA in the war.  Lindbergh declares, 'We cannot blame them for looking out for what they believe to be their own interest, but we also must look out for ours.  We cannot allow the natural passions and prejudices of other peoples to lead our country to destruction.'  While the speech rallies the America Firsters, the explicit identification of a religious minority among the special interest groups generates a firestorm of criticism of Lindbergh and the America First movement.  Socialist and pacifist Norman Thomas called it 'amazingly hurtful.'  Lindbergh continues to speak but privately lays plans to withdraw from the leadership of the America First movement.;;;;;;;;;;X

The clause of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 that prohibited this lapsed in 1937.  The Navy Department is very agitated by this since it will make relief of the Philippines in time of war with Japan almost impossible before the islands may fall.

CEVTDESC_322477;The Japanese have sent a peace mission to the Washington.  However, the USA has recently cracked the Japanese diplomatic ciphers.  In decoding and translating the message traffic between Washington and Tokyo, US negotiators get the sense that the Japanese officials in Tokyo are 'stringing along' their diplomats in Washington.

CEVTDESC_322480;Germany, having acquired the Dutch East Indies, honors treaty commitments to the Japanese Empire and turns over these territories to the Japanese Empire.

CEVTNAME_322481;Lindbergh Discusses Airpower;;;;;;;;;;X 
CEVTDESC_322481;Charles Lindbergh makes a speech on national security and airpower.  He notes that due to America's geography, whoever controls Europe or Asia must cross oceans to reach the USA.  Furthermore, unless an enemy is capable of seizing nearby islands such as Bermuda, the Bahamas or the Aleutians, airpower based in the United States would destroy the invading fleets.  Since the aforementioned islands are close the USA, its airpower would also be able to destroy fleets intent on taking those islands.  Therefore, American security is best served in building up local defenses instead of engaging any potential enemy far from home.  Intervention in foreign wars would be an unwise thing.;;;;;;;;;;X

The best way to do that is to place the National Guard, a part-time militia, under federal control and give the army the job of training the Guardsmen up to Regular Army standards.  New recruiting will have to be authorized to replace men who are unfit for duty or get exemptions.  Also money for new equipment will need to be appropriated.

Partisans of both sides work to strengthen or weaken, based on their own interests, the new government in Madrid in the eyes of the American public, business, and government.  What's more, it suggests to some people that force and violence can be justified to advance a stalled political agenda instead of abiding by the law.

Issuing a warning to the Axis that further expansion will not be tolerated and increasing the military budget is a reasonable 'middle of the road' choice but may be perceived as insufficiently decisive by those who oppose the current administration.  There has also been some calls for seeking closer ties with Germany to avoid any risk of war.;;;;;;;;;;X

CTECN_3010;Direction finding stations;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_3010;The establishment of 'Y' stations during the Great War was a direct consequence of the increased use of wireless communications.  By using multiple stations it was possible to triangulate the location of an enemy fleet, greatly improving the ability to track the enemy without being in close viusal contact.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_3011;Basic signals intercept vehicle;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_3011;As the use of wireless signalling became widespread it quickly became obvious that the interception of enemy communications could allow a decisive advantage.  This led to the development of vehicles that were dedicated to listening in on enemy communications from positions close to the front.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_3012;Code Talkers;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_3012;The languages of Native American tribes were almost completely unknown outside of Europe and this was recognised as an advantage as early as 1918, when during the Great War the US Army used Choctaw Code Talkers to ensure secure communications and therefore surprise in an attack against German positions in the Argonne forest.  This practise continued during the Second World War with active recruitment of Choctaws, Kiowas, Navajos, Hopis, Cherokees, Commanches, Winnebagos, Seminoles and others.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_3107;Early Intelligence establishment;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_3107;The processing and decryption of high volumes of enemy signals increasingly required a dedicated intelligence establishment.  This included institutes that provided training for intelligence analysts, auxiliary organisations that provided operators for the increasingly complex electro-mechanical devices used for and dedicated intelligence centers such as Bletchley Park and Arlington Hall where each nations most skilled cryptanalysts would work together on breaking enemy codes.;;;;;;;;;;X

CTECN_3603;Codification of the Navajo language;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_3603;Building on US Army experience from both the Great War and the Second World War, the US Marine Corps undertook a project to codify and refine the Code Talker practise into a real security discipline.  The Marine Corps used Navajos exclusively as it was perceived that their language was virtually unknown outside the Navajo nation, there was no written language and it's complex tonal inflections made it extremely difficult to learn as an adult.  Historically 400 Navajos and one Caucasian became part of the Marine Corps code talking program and the code was never broken.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_3604;Improved signals intercept vehicle;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_3604;As the mobility of modern armies increased the usefulness of fixed stations for signals interception decreased.  Mobile signals vehicles became more important and this encouraged further development of these highly specialized vehicles.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_3707;Sound Locator;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_3707;Mortars were very effective at breaking up infantry assaults and pinning troops while remaining hidden.  Research into counter-measures resulted in the GR-6 Sound Locator, a device that used three microphones to pin-point enemy mortar positions with great accuracy.  Historically this was first used by US troops in the battle for Okinawa.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_3805;Pulse code modulation;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_3805;Pulse code modulation was first applied to voice transmission during the effort to develop secure voice transmission over telephone lines.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_3806;Bandwidth compression;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_3806;In order to achieve near real time results with encryption and decryption of voice data streams it is necessary to use bandwidth compression.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_3807;Multilevel frequency shift keying;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_3807;Phase-shift keying is a form of modulation in which the phase of the carrier signal is shifted to represent digital data.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_3808;Secure voice encryption;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_3808;The first voice encryption system for telephones was the SIGSALY system developed by Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1943.  The system consisted of 40 racks of equipment and weighed 55 tons.  Initially it was installed in the Pentagon and in London to provide secure communications and by the end of the war there was twelve systems installed worldwide.  The systems was based on random noise acetate records and was generally considered to have poor voice quality but good security.  It used several new technologies, such as pulse code modulation for speech transmission, bandwidth compression and multilevel frequency shift keying.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_3944;Joint services cryptology;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_3944;As the size and numbers of various intelligence operations expanded far beyond what planners had envisaged it became obvious that separate army services and government ministries were duplicating efforts and sometimes compromising each others work by retransmitting information using less secure ciphers than the original transmission.  The solution was to establish single national organization to manage all cryptology research and development as well as signals intelligence interception and processing.;;;;;;;;;;X

CTECN_10819;Improved Drop Tanks;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_10819;New materials such as aluminium and gradual improvements to the drop tank design led to increased fuel capacity and reduced drag problems, allowing light aircraft unprecedented range and time over target.  This technology was crucial for allowing escorts to follow bomber formations all the way to targets deep in enemy territory.;;;;;;;;;;X

CTECD_10820;Further improvements to the centerline drop tank design and the addition of mounting points for additional tanks on the wings of light aircraft allowed further range improvements without compromising combat performance.

CEVTDESC_322423;Auto racing was a popular sport in the USA.  The biggest race in the USA during the 1930s was the Indianapolis 500 which consisted of 200 laps around a 2 1/2 mile oval at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

CEVTDESC_322459;Air racing was a popular sport in the USA after the Great War.  Two major events were the Thompson Trophy and the National Air Races.  Organizers would set up tall towers to mark a course and pilots would have to negotiate a circuit outside the towers without exceeding a fixed altitude.  To win, pilots had to optimize aircraft for speed and maneuverability.  This led to refinements in superchargers, high octane fuel, airlerons, and other technology. These racing aircraft were essentially privately financed light fighter test beds.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_322460;Pilots and aircraft manufacturers also conducted long distance flights to demonstrate their prowess and capability.  For example, Howard Hughes and Ben Kelsey dueled for cross-country speed records.  This resulted in prototype aircraft which were long-ranged and fast, such as Hughes' Lockheed Gamma aircraft.  They were generally larger than the closed course racers in order to carry more fuel.  For all intents and purposes, these were privately financed medium range fighter test beds.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTNAME_322468;Seabiscuit vs. War Admiral;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_322468;Seabiscuit was an unlikely champion.  Though he counted triple crown winner Man O'War among his grandsires, he was small and fiercely temperamental.  Jockey Red Pollard helped train him into a champion.  Seabiscuit caught the imagination of the public, becoming a metaphor for the down and out everyman who simply looked for an opportunity to show his worth.  This was especially true after recovering from a leg injury so serious that most trainers would have put down the horse.  War Admiral was the dominant thoroughbred of his generation.  A son of Man o'War, he had swept the triple crown in 1937. Huge and strong, he was a thorough champion.  The two horses met in a match race on November 1, 1938.  The race was broadcast live and 40 million Americans took time from their day to listen to it on radio. Against all expectation, but not against all hope, Seabiscuit emerged triumphant in the home stretch, winning by four lengths.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_322469;In the summer of 1937, the America's Cup was again up for grabs.  This was the day of the J-class yacht.  These were enormous sloops, 120 feet or more long with a mast over 150 feet tall bearing over 7500 square feet of canvas. A crew of 40 or more worked the ship.  These vessels were the ultimate in aristocratic grace and elegance.  In the waters off Newport, Rhode Island, owner Mike Vanderbilt skippered the USA's Ranger to beat English challenger's T. O. M. Sopwith's Endeavor II in four straight races.  Ranger is notable for being the first championship yacht to have her design tuned with modeling in a tow tank to minimize drag with an optimal hull form.;;;;;;;;;;X  
CTECN_3008;Cathode Ray Tube;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_3008;This is a specialized electronic tube that can create an image.  The back side of the screen is coated with chemicals, such as zinc sulfide, which glow when struck by electrons.  An electron 'gun' is formed by arranging that electrons from the cathode will have to pass through a region of electromagnetic flux.  A signal controls the charge to the plates, adjust how many electrons will hit and excite the chemicals on the screen.  The more electrons, the greater is the brightness.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_3105;Iconoscope;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_3105;This is a specialized electronic tube that can capture black and white images.  A signal plate that is covered with an array of silver and cesium dots that has an oxide finish.  A lens focuses an image on the plate and the photo-electric effect puts charge on the dots.  An electron beam scans the dots and discharges each dot.  The discharges are picked up as electrical signals on an electrode that is separated from the dots by a mica plate.  This signal encodes the visual data from the image.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_3106;Television Broadcasting;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_3106;One can use the iconoscope to capture visual information and a microphone to capture the audio, then broadcast this signal via radio waves.  A receiver sorts the visual and audio signal streams, reproducing the audio via a speaker and the visual data on a cathode ray tube.  This is television. Gameplay note: this technology can trigger various events.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_3301;Punch Cards;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_3301;Punch card encoding of data was invented by Charles Babbage in the mid-19th century for his 'difference engine.'  During the 1930s 'Hollerith' encoding was picked up for the encoding of bureaucratic data by the US Social Security Administration and the Census Bureau.  It also found a home in science applications.  IBM, among others, married the type writer to the card puncher to create the 'keypunch' machine.  This let individuals with secretarial skills encode data for use in electromechanical calculating machines.;;;;;;;;;;X

CTECD_3975;This was the first device created for data storage in electromechanical computers. This application is required for the development of improved electromechanical computers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_4406;Systemized Worker Training;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_4406;Many of the industrialized countries operated as though workmen operated in a 'craft' atmosphere.  They believed that a machinist or welder required years of training and experience.  However, within the discipline of industrial engineering, time and motion studies, the Taylorite breakdown of almost every industrial task into a series of simple motions and uses of the appropriate tools, meant that unskilled workers could be taught most factory jobs in a matter of a few months.  Greater industrial productivity was possible as enough people could be trained to run the factories on more of a multi-shift basis.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_4804;Full Industrial Mobilization;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_4804;Most industrial jobs were held by men.  However, the increasing mechanization of many factory jobs meant that the physical requirements could be met by most women.  If a systemized training system was in place, the fairer sex provided an untapped source of workers who could release men for combat duty and expand the labor pool for closer to 7x24 (seven day/week, 24 hours/day) factory operation.  'Rosie the Riveter' was a real person.  Rose Will Monroe was a line worker at Ford's Willow Run bomber factory.  She passed away on 31st May 1997 in Clarksdale, Indiana.  The sociological effects of transforming the late-industrial family: breadwinner, spouse, and children to permit both adults to have out of the home jobs would echo for decades.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_4942;Semiconductor Fabrication Equipment;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_4942;Once perfect crystals of Germanium or Silicon Germanium are available, specialized equipment to inject precisely patterned dopants into the crystals in commercial quantities and reasonable cost are necessary.  Also machines to remove the individual semiconductor 'chips' from the manufactured array and then package them so that they can electrically connect to the outside world and still remain protected from corrosion are necessary.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_4975;Improved Semiconductor Fabrication Equipment;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_4975;Once the basic technology for the fabrication and packaging of semiconductor circuits was established, engineers sought to make things smaller, faster, cheaper, and more reliable.  New equipment enabled better semiconductors that would, in turn, provide more powerful products.  Moore's Law, that semiconductors would double in capability or halve in price every 18 months, was born.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_4976;Silicon Crystal Ingot;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_4976;The original semiconductor transistors used a Germanium substrate.  Improved performance required a different material.  Silicon was suitable, once a method for fabricating a pure crystalline ingot from pure molten silicon.  The ingot had to then be cooled and sliced into thin wafers where the solid state semiconductor junctions could be implanted.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_12503;Air-to-Air Refueling Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_12503;In 1917, a pilot in the Imperial Russian Navy, Alexander P. de Seversky, proposed increasing the range of combat aircraft by refueling them in flight. In the interwar years, air-to-air refueling was demonstrated in long duration flying records that eventually reached 27 days. World War II brought about a hiatus in aerial refueling technology development as combatants sought to develop extremely long-range aircraft with large internal fuel capacity. With the advent of jet-powered bombers that consumed far more fuel than piston-engine planes, the need for air-to-air refueling resurfaced as an operational requirement.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_9998;Rigid Flying Boom System;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9998;In the push for better aerial refueling methods, the Rigid Flying Boom System was developed, consisting of a large-diameter pipe connected to the rear of a prototype tanker and fitted with small wings at the end. The boom was lowered and 'flown' to a connector on the receiver aircraft. This allowed fuel transfers to take place at higher speeds and, more importantly, allow much more fuel to flow per minute.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_9992;Single Point Refueling System;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9992;Another important development in air-to-air refueling was the single-point refueling system on receiver aircraft, which allowed all of an airplane's several fuel tanks to be refilled from a single spot instead of from multiple nozzles around the airplane.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_9997;Tanker Aircraft;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_9997;With the practical problems of air-to-air refueling solved, the deployment of the a tanker fleet is required to meet operational needs of the Air Force.  The conversion of existing bomber and transport designs provided a capable tanker fleet.  Historically, the US KB-29 and KC-97 tankers were the first generation of tankers.  However, given the scarcity of tankers, their main operational use was for strategic jet bombers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_13114;Naval Tradition (UK-Only);;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_13114;The Royal Navy has a tradition of victory and service which extends for centuries.

CTECN_N8;Nuclear Research;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8;This field of research allows a nation to develop nuclear theory, advanced research institutes, new weapons and highly advanced power plants. The weapons can be used against the enemy with a tremendous destructive effect.  Nuclear propulsion can be used to construct highly advanced warships and nuclear power stations can greatly increase industrial output.  However, this field of research is very costly and has some pitfalls as it explores completely new areas of research where a mistake can be fatal.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8000;Elementary Physics & Chemistry;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8000;At the close of the old century, physics was entering an exciting period where the secrets of the atom were beginning to be unraveled.  Great fights were waged on whether light was a particle or a wave.  And the effects and causes of radiation were explored.  Great minds, often working alone or in the company of a select few, made vast strides in their laboratories.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8001;Radium;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8001;Discovered in 1898 by Marie Curie from pitchblende ores found in Bohemia. One of the first radioactive elements discovered.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8002;Radium Isolation;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8002;Isolated in 1911 by Curie and Debierne by the electrolysis of a solution of pure radium chloride employing a mercury cathode. On distillation in an atmosphere of hydrogen, this amalgam yielded the pure metal. Production would be possible with conventional electroplating technology.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8003;Polonium;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8003;Discovered in 1898 by Marie Curie. It is also found in the Bohemian pitchblendes that provide Radium. However, the concentrations are far lower (0.2% that of radium). It is also far more radioactive.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8004;Polonium Isolation;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8004;It is found in combination with Bismuth. Concentrated Polonium gives off dangerous levels of radioactivity and can ionize the air near a sample so it is surrounded by a blue glow.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8005;Alpha Particle Detection;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8005;Rutherford had discovered on Alpha Particles in 1899, but mistakenly took them for radiation, like x-rays. By 1903 he experimentally demonstrated that he could bend a stream of Alpha beam in strong electric and magnetic fields, demonstrating that it was a positively charged particle. Alpha particles are a helium nucleus, two protons and two neutrons and can only travel a few centimeters through the air before being stopped.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8006;Beta Particle Detection;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8006;Henri Becquerel discovered Beta Particles in 1900. Beta particles are free electrons released by atomic decay or a nuclear reaction. They can travel a few meters through the air before being stopped.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8007;Gamma Ray Detection;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8007;Discovered by Paul Villard around the turn of the century, they were conclusively demonstrated to be photons by Lord Ernest Rutherford in 1914. Gamma Rays are caused by atomic decay or nuclear reactions, and have very high energy and short wavelengths. Gamma rays can travel interstellar distances.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8008;Mass Spectrometer Theory;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8008;Originally developed by J. J. Thompson in 1899 in the United Kingdom, this notes that as one places ionized atoms under electrical and magnetic fields in the hard vacuum of a cathode ray tube, the trajectory of the atoms will vary depending on the mass and charge of the atom. The atoms left impressions on a photographic plate and were instrumental in experimentally proving the existence of isotopes of stable, non-radioactive atoms.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8009;Geiger Counter Production;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8009;The Geiger Counter was invented by Hans Geiger in 1928 and utilizes the Geiger-Mueller tube that detects ionizing radiation passing through a tube of inert gas and organic vapor. The more fragile mica window type will detect photons, alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays. The glass window type is sturdier, but does not detect alpha particles.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8010;Basic Theory of Radiation;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8010;In 1913 Niels Bohr, who had been mentored by Lord Ernest Rutherford, published a theory of radiation which postulated that the atom consisted of a nucleus surrounded by electrons. There were stable energy states for the atom, and if an imbalance occurred, then radiation resulted as the atom shed the appropriate particle necessary to restore equilibrium. Bohr won the 1922 Nobel Prize in Physics for this work.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8100;Advanced Physics & Chemistry;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8100;Following the Great War scientists continued to develop and amplify Bohr's Theory of Radiation.  In addition, gifted scientist/engineers began to design new tools to aid their research into atomic physics.  Science remained an international and largely European endeavour, but an increasing number of the tools were being developed in North America.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8101;Large Van de Graaff Generator Construction;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8101;This was developed in 1929 by Robert J. Van de Graaff at Princeton University in the USA. An electrode connected to a hollow sphere is raised to a high potential and then a rapidly moving silk belt carries ionized negative charge to an electrode inside the sphere. The large potential difference between the two electrodes ionizes the air inside the sphere. Potentials of up to a million volts were possible by the early 1930s.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8102;Mass Spectrometer Construction;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8102;An associate of J. J. Thompson, Francis W. Aston of Cambridge University refined the basic mass spectrometer of Thompson and achieved an order of magnitude improvement in precision in the late teens. This led more precise study of isotopes a Nobel Prize for Aston in 1922. In 1920, Canadian-born A. J. Dempster of the University of Chicago made further refinements with directional focusing and developed a method to ionize the samples with a beam of electrons from a hot wire filament. Both innovations are still used in many modern mass spectrometers, and helped convert a scientific novelty into a useful research instrument.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8103;Isotope Isolation;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8103;Once the Mass Spectrometer was refined so it had sufficient accuracy, research into the variety of different atomic isotopes could proceed. During the 1920s there was widespread research into identifying the various isotopes of the elements.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8104;Alpha Particle Generation;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8104;In 1928, Walter Bothe bombarded a Beryllium target with alpha particles from Polonium. This gave off a ìhigh energy photonî which eventually was shown to be neutron. Bothe also demonstrated that you use the highly radioactive element of Polonium to bombard substances and create a reaction.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8105;The Neutron;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8105;In 1932, Irene Joliet-Curie and her husband Frederic used Polonium to bombard paraffin with a Polonium source and also detected a positively charged particle in reaction. 1932, Sir James Chadwick, an associate of Lord Ernest Rutherford, repeated the Curieís work on paraffin and used a number of other targets. He was able to prove that there was a neutrally charged particle that was a consequence of the bombardment. This was the neutron, announced in a paper Chadwick authored in the 27th February issue of Nature. In 1935, Chadwick won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8106;Artificial Radiation;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8106;In 1932, the Irene and Frederic Joliot-Curie bombarded boron and aluminum with alpha particles and created new radioactive isotopes of nitrogen and phosphorus. This artificial radiation created a stir in the world of physics and won the husband and wife team a joint Nobel Prize in Physics in 1935.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8107;Basic Cyclotron Theory;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8107;Natural sources of radioactivity were too weak and did not produce enough radioactivity for good research. Lord Ernest Rutherford made a plea for a more powerful source of particles. Ernest Lawrence, a young researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, developed and patented the idea of the cyclotron. This used an alternating electric field to accelerate particles through a strong magnetic field. In early 1931 he built his first cyclotron and a larger model finished in the summer had a 1.1 million volt capacity. This accomplishment won Lawrence the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1939.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8108;Neutron Bombardment;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8108;Enrico Fermi recognized that the neutrally charged neutron would do a better job bombarding the positively charged nucleus of the atom than the positively charged alpha particle. He embarked on a program to bombard all of the known elements with neutrons and discovered 40 radioactive isotopes of the elements. Fermi and his team also observed that bombardment of nuclei with neutrons resulted in the emission of alpha and beta particles, protons, positrons, and gamma radiation. This 1934 work on neutron bombardment resulted in a Nobel Prize in Physics for 1938.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8200;Basic Nuclear Physics;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8200;By the mid-1930s the three basic building blocks of the atom:  the proton, neutron, and electron, had been discovered and it was known that some types of materials gave off different kinds of radiation.  The challenge was now to discover the mechanism behind the creation of radiation.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8201;Decay Product Identification;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8201;Fermiís work had produced a number of radioactive isotopes. With this raw material, scientists studied these isotopes and established that as these isotopes decayed, they gave off radiation and would shift down to stable isotopes of the element or lower atomic number elements. In some cases these lower elements were radioactive isotopes in their own right that would undergo a series of transformations until stable isotopes resulted. Although some decay products had been mapped as early as 1935, the story took some time to unfold.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8202;Fission Observation;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8202;Joliot-Curie had confirmed Fermiís results on the bombardment of Uranium by 1938, but believed that the by-products included transuranic isotopes of Thorium and Actinium. Ida Noddack, co-discoverer of the element Rhenium, had postulated that bombardment might result lighter elements, fission, but did not follow up on the work. Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner, and Fritz Strassman, working in Berlin, chemically separated the by-products of uranium bombardment into radium and barium, both of which were radioactive. In December 1938, they concluded that barium-like material was a bombardment by-product, but could not bring themselves to conclude fission of uranium atom into two lighter elements had occurred.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8203;Fission Measurement;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8203;During 1939, Hahn followed up with colleague Lise Meitner who had emigrated to Sweden to escape the Naziís. Meitner worked with her nephew Otto Frisch, who had emigrated to Denmark and was working in Bohrís laboratory in Copenhagen. Following up on the work published by Hahn and Strassman, Meitner and Frisch realized that energy would be released as the two fission products separated. Their calculations indicated a value 200 MeV for uranium fission. According to the atomic weights of the uranium fission by-products, some mass was converted to energy in the act of fission. Applying Einsteinís equation e = mc2, they found that the energy and mass figures checked out. Frisch quickly returned to Copenhagen and empirically verified their calculations.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8204;Fission Theory;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8204;Frisch told Niels Bohr about the work he and Meitner had done on fission. They had proposed a theory that when a neutron entered the nucleus it caused the nucleus to change shape, vibrate a break apart, building on one of Bohrís own ideas. Bohr considered those observations with his own insights on the structure of the atom. Bohr built on their insights to develop a theory for fission that he shared at a conference at in Washington on 17th January 1939.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8205;Chain Reaction Verification;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8205;In 1934, Leo Szilard, a Hungarian expatriate physicist in Britain, filed patents for the release of nuclear energy through the transmutation of elements in a chain reaction. In 1935, Szilard amended the patent to cite Uranium and Bromine as specific elements that could be used for this purpose. In 1936, the British Admiralty accepted these patents (under British law the only way the patent could be kept secret was if a government agency itself held the patent). However, the reality of a nuclear chain reaction depended upon more neutrons being given off in a fission reaction than were required to create the fission. Bohr was arguing for experimental verification of this within days of his discussion of fission theory in Washington. Within a matter of weeks in early 1939, Szilardís theory had been empirically confirmed by Lew Kowarski at the Columbia University.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8206;Basic Cyclotron Construction;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8206;Ernest Lawrence continued to build larger and more powerful cyclotrons at the University of California, Berkeley. After Lawrence won the Nobel Prize in 1939, the Rockefeller Foundation donated $1.4 million to build a 100 MeV cyclotron at his laboratory in Berkeley. In 1940, the USA had twice as many cyclotrons in service or in construction as the rest of the world combined.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8207;Transuranic Elements;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8207;It was believed that bombardment of Uranium with alpha particles would produce elements with an atomic number beyond that of Uranium, a transuranic element. Much of the earlier experimental work leading to fission was a consequence of failed attempts to find such transuranic elements. However, another factor here was transformation of physics from table-top experiments to the need to use large cyclotrons and other tools costing hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars. This covers upgrading the major science labs with this more elaborate and complicated equipment.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8208;Organized R&D Laboratories (USA Only);;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8208;Science was being transformed by the industrialization of knowledge creation.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8209;Neptunium;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8209;In the spring of 1940, Edward McMillan and Philip Abelson, working in the UC-Berkeley Rad Lab, bombarded uranium-238 with 12 MeV neutrons produced by bombarding a beryllium target with cyclotron accelerated deuterons. Based on the knowledge of how lighter radioactive isotopes decayed it was hoped that new higher atomic weight elements might be created. In fact, the experiment created U-239, which decayed into Neptunium, the first transuranic element.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8210;Plutonium;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8210;Glenn Seaborg led another UC-Berkeley team to search for the next transuranic element beginning in the summer of 1940. Bombarding uranium with 16 MeV deuterons, a different isotope of Neptunium was created which decayed into Plutonium 238. The plutonium could be chemically separated from the other materials.;;;;;;;;;;X

CTECD_N8211;Science was being transformed by the industrialization of knowledge creation and the formation of R&D labs where scientists could work together on high-cost, leading edge projects was a necessity that was gradually recognized around the world. This concentration of effort streamlined not only the work itself but also the procurement of political support and funding.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8300;Basic Nuclear Experimentation;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8300;Fission was only imperfectly understood.  Once again engineering was required to develop new tools to quantify the characteristics of nuclear physics.  These tools would include new materials, chemical procedures, and theoretical calculations about the basic properties of matter.  Furthermore, the complexity and cost of the tools was growing so great that the old model of a brilliant professor in his or her laboratory was giving way to new research and development establishments, sponsored by a university or government.  Finally, the possibility of creating a nuclear explosive was being explored.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8301;Supporting Nuclear Materials;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8301;In order to move into larger scale experimentation on nuclear research, significant technical enhancements in supporting technologies was necessary;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8302;Micro-Chemistry;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8302;In order to isolate the initial U-235 samples it was necessary to develop advanced analytical techniques which would permit the separation of this isotope of Uranium from the vastly more prevalent U-238 isotope.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8303;Heavy Water Production;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8303;Heavy water occurs when the water molecule has two deuterium atoms instead of a regular hydrogen atoms bonding to the oxygen atom. This molecule slows down neutron particles that pass through it. Heavy water was commercially available as a by-product of an ammonia factory in Norway that was built to take advantage of cheap hydro-electric power in 1934. The ammonia was used as a feedstock for artificial fertilizer;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8304;Purified Graphite Production;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8304;Graphite was broadly used in industry for its conductive properties, but it was also found that it would moderate neutrons, creating interest in this material as an alternative to heavy water to serve as a structural material and moderator in a controlled a nuclear chain reaction. Using this in atomic applications required purification to remove trace elements of boron and calcium from the matrix of graphite.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8305;Large Cyclotron Construction;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8305;These machines were able to raise particles to higher and higher potentials in order to generate more energetic subatomic interactions. While still useful as experimental vehicles, the increasing precision and control of these machines also permitted accurate measurements of various sub-atomic interactions.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8306;Nuclear Piles;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8306;In order to demonstrate a controlled chain reaction and make measurements in order to validate key parts of theory, it was necessary to fabricate a nuclear pile. There were two basic types of piles developed during the 1940s, the heavy water pile and the graphite moderated pile.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8308;Heavy Water Pile Construction;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8308;This pile uses U238 as a fuel. Heavy water is used as a moderator. The bombardment of the U238 by the slow neutrons moderated by the heavy water results in creation of Plutonium which can be chemically separated from the U238. This was the approach favored by Heisenberg and his team of researchers in Germany. Their design featured alternating layers of Uranium and Paraffin which was suspended in a heavy water tank.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8309;Graphite Pile Construction;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8309;This approach was used by the Americans and Soviets in their research. It used uranium embedded in blocks of purified graphite with cadmium control rods that could be inserted or removed from the stack of material. The cadmium absorbed neutrons, damping the chain reaction.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8310;Basic Uranium Metallurgy;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8310;Uranium had been something of a novelty element prior to 1930s. Its salts were radioactive, but there were no major industrial applications for the metal. Belgium had mines in the Congo that produced the metal.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8311;Uranium Oxide Production;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8311;Most uranium ores are oxides of uranium: U3O8, UO2, UO3. Concentrations of U308 vary from as much as 20% in some Canadian ores to only 0.5% in some Australian ores. The ore is mechanically ground up in ball mills and subjected to a variety of chemical processes that result in ìYellowcakeî, pure U3O8. ;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8312;Uranium Purification;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8312;The yellowcake, U3O8, is dissolved in nitric acid and then subjected to a series of chemical reactions which generate a tremendous amount of toxic chemical by-products. Pure uranium metal can be obtained by reducing uranium tetrafluoride with either calcium or magnesium. However, the pure uranium will contain a mixture of both U235 and U238. ;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8313;U235 Isolation;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8313;Small quantities of U235 could be extracted from the mix of U235 and U238. This permitted experimental confirmation of the reaction of U235 atoms to fast neutrons that was necessary to show that relatively small, transportable quantities of U235 could be used in an atomic reaction.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8314;Plutonium Isolation;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8314;Once Plutonium had been created it was necessary to identify the chemical processes required to remove it and leave a pure metallic form. Glenn Seaborg led the team that accomplished this on 20th August 1942.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8315;Chain Reaction Calculations;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8315;In order to calculate the amount of heat and radiation given off in a chain reaction, it was necessary to perform calculations on the size of the various atoms involved compared to the neutrons that would strike them. Furthermore, it was necessary to get some level of empirical confirmation since these numbers varied by up to four orders of magnitude (10,000 times) depending on the who did the calculations and the assumptions that they used.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8316;Beryllium Cross Section Calculation;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8316;The critical question for fission was the size of the nucleus compared to the atom. In the case of Beryllium, it was found that neutrons striking this atom would be reflected back out of the atom. This was historically completed in 1941.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8317;U238 Cross Section Calculation;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8317;The critical question for fission was the size of the nucleus compared to the atom. This would give an estimate for the chance that a neutron passing through the atom would strike the nucleus and create a reaction. The U238 was not as reactive as the U235 and so was identified as more suitable for a reactor fuel. This was completed by July, 1941.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8318;U235 Cross Section Calculation;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8318;The critical question for fission was the size of the nucleus compared to the atom. This would give an estimate for the chance that a neutron passing through the atom would strike the nucleus and create a reaction. The U235 was much more reactive than the U238 and calculations suggested that as little as 1 kg might be suitable to create a bomb. The actual initial bombs used about 50 kg per weapon. This was completed in July 1941 in the west, and by December 1941 in the USSR.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8319;Plutonium Cross Section;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8319;The critical question for fission was the size of the nucleus compared to the atom. This would give an estimate for the chance that a neutron passing through the atom would strike the nucleus and create a reaction. Plutonium was identified as a prime candidate for fission.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8320;Nuclear Weapons Theory;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8320;Finally, all the pieces are available to make a reasonable estimate on how much fissionable material is necessary to make a how big of a bang. Though science fiction speculations had been afloat for years from H. G. Wells and others, and serious scientists had speculated about this possibility since fission measurements were made, the state of the art had now reached the point that it was clear an explosive device of unprecedented potency was possible, if the engineering problems could be solved. A British committee, headed by Sir Henry Tizard, produced the MAUD Report which was approved on July 15, 1941. It concluded that a bomb with as little of 25 pounds of U-235 could explode with a force equivalent to 1800 tons of TNT.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8321;Fusion Bomb Feasibility;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8321;During the spring of 1941, Enrico Fermi speculated that the heat and pressure of a nuclear explosion might create conditions for hydrogen to fuse together into helium and produce even more energy. Edward Teller studied the problem and convinced himself that the reaction would not work. However, in Japan, Hakutaro Hagiwara of the University of Kyoto gave a paper in May 1941, outlining a proposal for a bomb consisting of enriched U-235 and then igniting hydrogen for an even greater explosion;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8322;Uranium Hexafluoride Creation;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8322;During 1941, Philip Abelson of the University of California, Berkeley, developed a practical, relatively inexpensive way to create the gas Uranium Hexafluoride. Given the international situation, he licensed the patent rights to the US government for one dollar and still never collected the dollar.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8400;Basic Nuclear Theory;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8400;With new tools and data, it was now possible to build experimental nuclear 'piles' which could be used to test and verify theories.  Methods to separate atomic isotopes could also be developed.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8407;Graphite Nuclear Pile Experimentation;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8407;Once nuclear piles were constructed, it was necessary to conduct experiments to measure and verify the amount of heat and radiation given off by chain reactions. This would permit more refined calculations of the nuclear reactions that were taking place. The worldís first self-sustained chain reaction took place during December 1942 in a pile constructed on the grounds of the University of Chicago under the direction of Enrico Fermi.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8408;Heavy Water Nuclear Pile Experimentation;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8408;Once nuclear piles were constructed, it was necessary to conduct experiments to measure and verify the amount of heat and radiation given off by chain reactions. This would permit more refined calculations of the nuclear reactions that were taking place.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8409;Graphite Production Pile Theory;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8409;Once sufficient experiments were performed, it was possible to design a nuclear pile which would be fueled with U238, operated a period of time, and then harvested for the Plutonium that would created during the course of the fission reaction. The Plutonium would then be chemically isolated from the Uranium and used as the fissile material for a Plutonium bomb. Engineering issues associated with this included cooling, extraction of the fissile material and its byproducts, and control of the chain reaction in the pile.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8410;Heavy Water Production Pile Theory;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8410;Once sufficient experiments were performed it was possible to design a heavy water pile which would be fueled with U238, operated a period of time, and then harvested for the Plutonium that could be isolated from the Uranium and used as the fissile material for a Plutonium bomb. Engineering issues associated with this included cooling, extraction of the fissile material and its byproducts, and control of the chain reaction in the pile.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8411;Isotope Isolation;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8411;There are two major isotopes of Uranium. U235 and U238. Since they are chemically identical, traditional methods to separate the materials were ineffective and novel techniques relying on the different atomic weight had to be imagined. There were multiple solutions including thermal diffusion, gaseous diffusion, electromagnetic diffusion and centrifuge separation.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8412;Gaseous Diffusion Separation Engineering;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8412;This method of isotope separation depended on the fact that the lighter isotope of uranium, in the gaseous form of Uranium Hexafluoride, would move more quickly through a finely perforated barrier. A sufficient number of barriers, in the thousands, would result in a much higher concentration of the U235 isotope in the gas at the end of the barriers than at the beginning. This was demonstrated at Columbia University in November 1941, but full scale engineering started in the spring of 1942. Getting an effective permeable membrane was a key piece part of this process and part of its difficulty.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8413;Thermal Columnar Separation Engineering;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8413;The theory behind this was similar to the Gaseous Diffusion Separation but depended on the superior mobility of lighter atoms when driven by heat instead of the mobility of lighter atoms through permeable membranes. Philip Abelson was working with the US Navy to develop nuclear reactors as power sources for their submarines. He sought to improve the efficiency of the reactors with an enriched U-235 fuel. A prototype system was built at the Naval Research Laboratory in 1942 that was 36 feet tall, used steam and hot water, and whose only moving parts were the recirculating pumps.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8414;Cyclotron Separation Engineering;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8414;Ernest Lawrence realized that if the uranium isotopes could be ionized, then shooting them through the strong magnetic field of a cyclotron would result in the lighter isotope being deflected less than the heavier isotope. By arranging to catch the lighter U-235 separately from the heavier U-238, one could isolate the two isotopes. The instrument to do this would be called a Calutron.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8415;Centrifuge Separation;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8415;If the Uranium could be placed into solution, then the resultant solution could be centrifuged. The heavier U-238 would settle to the bottom and the lighter U-235 would be concentrated at the top. After sufficient time to achieve separation, then the U-235 would be decanted off.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8500;Applied Nuclear Theory;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8500;The two basic applications for fission were as an explosive and as a source of heat or energy.  The conceptual work to flesh out these applications was now necessary.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8501;Uranium Bomb Detonation Theory;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8501;The challenge was now to assemble subcritical masses of Uranium and then bring them together in such a way as to create a nuclear explosion. The solution involved designing a cannon to fire a uranium bullet at a precise velocity so it would pass through several rings of enriched U-235. As the bullet passed through the rings, a critical mass would be achieved and trigger a nuclear explosion.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8502;Plutonium Bomb Detonation Theory;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8502;The gun idea developed for a Uranium Bomb was unsuitable for a Plutonium bomb. In order to prevent a pre-detonation of the Plutonium (essentially a fizzle instead of a massive, energy-releasing chain reaction), the muzzle velocity of the bullet had to be about 1000 meters per second, which was impractical. Therefore, it was suggested that a shell of explosives around a Plutonium structure would be used to compress the Plutonium into a critical mass and start the nuclear reaction that way.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8503;Hydrogen Bomb Theory;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8503;Hans Bethe and Edward Tellar returned to the idea of a fusion bomb and calculated that the heat generated by an atomic explosion could be used to trigger a fusion reaction of even greater force if the right fuel elements were available. Preliminary calculations suggested that as little as six kilograms of liquid deuterium could unleash a 1 megaton explosion.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8504;Steam Generator Theory;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8504;Although water could be used to cool a reactor and generate steam, it was advisable to keep that subsequently radioactive coolant in its own loop of piping and arrange a heat exchanger to an outside loop that would be turned to steam and operate a turbine. Then the mechanical energy of the turbine could be geared down to turn a shipís propeller and/or drive an electric generator. All of this would emphasize small size and weight since submarines propulsion was immediately identified as an eventual goal for this line of research as well as conventional industrial power sources.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8505;Graphite Production Pile Construction;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8505;The production pile uses coin-shaped slugs of uranium that are inserted into hollow aluminum tubes that go through the core. After a certain period of time, the slugs are pushed through the tubes and fall into a large tank of water where the fiercely radioactive short half-life fission products decay. The reactor is reloaded and, after a safe period of time, the partially enriched uranium is removed from the tank so the Plutonium may be extracted. An unanticipated by-product of the initial design was that a Xenon isotope was one of the by-products and after a period of a few days, enough accumulated to damp the chain reaction. However, the US piles had margin to be expanded and adding about one third more uranium to the pile, created a dense enough neutron flux to overcome the dampening effect of the Xenon. Historically these piles were built at Hanford, Washington.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8506;Heavy Water Production Pile Construction;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8506;The production pile uses coin-shaped slugs of uranium that are inserted into multiple hollow aluminum tubes. An array of tubes is placed in the recirculating Heavy Water tank that moderates the chain reaction. Hoists move individual tubes closer or farther from the array as desired to modify the neutron flux density. After a certain period of time, the tubes are lifted out of the reactor and transferred to a ìcooling tankî where the slugs are pushed out and kept a large tank of water where the fiercely radioactive short half-life fission products decay. After a safe period of time, the partially enriched uranium is removed from the tank so the Plutonium may be extracted. An unanticipated by-product of the initial design was that a Xenon isotope was one of the by-products and after a period of a few days, enough accumulated to damp the chain reaction. The reactor needed to be redesigned for additional uranium to keep a dense enough neutron flux to overcome the dampening effect of the Xenon. ;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8600;Basic Nuclear Weapons Design;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8600;It was now clear that an atomic weapon was feasible but the necessary components had to be designed.  This involved finding a way to bring subcritical masses of fissile material in such a way that a run-away uncontrolled chain-reaction would take place.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8601;Uranium Bomb Detonator Engineering;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8601;Now the need was to realize the specific design for a uranium gun. A naval rifle was lightened and shortened since it was eventually realized that it would only need to fire once. The uranium bullet had to be designed. Also, the size of the charge had to be precisely calculated and tested since it was necessary for the uranium bullet to enter the uranium target rings with a precise velocity in order to achieve right rate of fission so the bomb would not ìfizzleî.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8602;Plutonium Bomb Detonator Engineering;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8602;To make the implosion concept work, it was necessary to develop a new order of magnitude in precision for explosives. Historically, test calculations were run on a bank of new IBM computers before being experimentally verified in a program that included thousands of test explosions. A key breakthrough involved understanding that one could shape the explosives to focus the shape of the shock wave, much as a glass lens focuses light. This was the Explosive Lens concept.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8603;Uranium Tamper Design;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8603;Placing a thick blanket of U-238 around the critical mass would boost the yield of the explosion by reflecting some of the neutrons back into the U-235 or Plutonium core as well as by getting some fission of the U-238 by the neutrons passing through the tamper.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8604;Initiator Design;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8604;The details of this device are actually still classified. It involves a device that would release neutrons to start the chain reaction only at precisely the correct moment.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8605;U238 Reactor Design;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8605;As part of atomic power plant development, it is necessary to design the right arrangement of shielding, control rods, moderator materials, nuclear fuel, and coolant so one can safely extract usable energy from the nuclear reactor.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8606;Hydrogen Bomb Design;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8606;Further calculations showed that Deuterium was an unsuitable fuel for a thermonuclear action. However, Tritium would do quite nicely. Furthermore, the power of a Hydrogen Bomb could be tuned by adjusting the amount of fuel placed in proximity to the triggering nuclear explosion.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8607;Improved R&D Labs;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8607;Science was being transformed by the industrialization of knowledge creation and the formation of R&D labs where scientists could work together on high-cost, leading edge projects was a necessity that was gradually recognized around the world. This concentration of effort streamlined not only the work itself but also the procurement of political support and funding. For most countries R&D labs were only formed in the post-war years.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8700;Nuclear Material Production;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8700;This is the creation of a entirely new industrial infrastructure dedicated to the production and extraction of useful quantities of fissile material.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8701;Uranium Hexafluoride Plant Construction;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8701;This factory provided the feedstock to the Permeable Membrane Production Plants and the Magnetic Separation Plant. The first industrial plant of this type was constructed at the Clinton Engineering Works on the Oak Ridge Nuclear reservation.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8702;Permeable Membrane Production Plant Construction;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8702;This factory makes the membranes which are used to separate the U-235 from U-238 isotopes in the Gaseous Diffusion Plan. The initial Norris-Adler Barrier, developed at Columbia University, used a nickel plated mesh which worked, but was very fragile. A factory was built in Decatur, Illinois to fabricate the mesh. By late 1943, the companies that were working on the gaseous diffusion plant, Kellex and Union Carbide, had developed an alternative method that relied on a compressed nickel powder barrier. After some contentious discussions, the factory under construction was converted to the nickel powder barrier.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8703;Gaseous Diffusion Plant Construction;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8703;This is the factory which implements the gaseous diffusion separation process. Historically, the plant at Oak Ridge, Tennessee that provided this capability to the USA required 4000 stages of enrichment. The process required new materials development to resist the corrosive Uranium Hexafluoride gas (what we would come to know as Teflon) and required a complete absence of grease or any other hydrocarbons in the diffusion chambers;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8704;Thermal Columnar Separation Plant Construction;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8704;Once the engineering for the Thermal Separation Plant was complete, a full factory could be established. The USA actually built two. A 300 column plant was constructed in the Philadelphia Navy Yard which operated off of waste steam from the Naval Boiler and Turbine Laboratory. However, a larger 2100 column was constructed at Oak Ridge starting in June 1944. Advanced welding techniques were necessary to reliably seal the system against steam leaks. ;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8705;Cyclotron Separation Plant Construction;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8705;The facility takes Uranium and accelerates the material through an electromagnetic field. Since the different isotopes have different masses, they will deposit on targets that are farther from the center of device if they have higher mass. The individual machines were named Calutrons in honor of the Berkeley Radiation Lab where cyclotrons were born. This type of facility was built at Oak Ridge, Tennessee by the US Manhattan Project.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8706;Uranium System;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8706;Initially, the directors of the Manhattan Project believed that the Isotope separation processes would compete against one another and one or the other would ìwinî. However, they realized that by using all of the processes together, they could accelerate the rate at which U-235 could be concentrated. The uranium cycle at Oak Ridge involved sending using the Thermal Diffusion plant to reach about 1% concentration. Then Uranium Tetrafluoride gas went through the gaseous diffusion plant to get 50% concentration. Then the partially concentrated gas was fed to the Calutrons in the magnetic separation facility to get weapons-grade 80% U235. That was converted back to the Uranium Tetrafluoride gas and shipped to Los Alamos in sub-critical quantities. Scientists there reduced the gas to Uranium metal. With all the plants operating, enough weapons-grade Uranium could be produced to make a bomb per month compared to one bomb every six months with the Calutrons alone. ;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8707;Plutonium Refinery Plant Construction;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8707;The micro-chemical processes pioneered by Glenn Seaborg were scaled up by more than a thousand fold to take the radioactive fission products from the Plutonium production piles and extract the weapons grade Plutonium. Historically, this plant was located on the Hanford Nuclear Reservation. ;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8708;Tritium Production;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8708;The necessary Tritium for the Hydrogen Bomb could be manufactured by bombarding Lithium with neutrons. This would require a production pile and refining operation, similar to those developed for Plutonium manufacture and isolation. Historically, this effort did not take place until after a nuclear arms race took off in the early years of the Cold War.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8709;Heavy Bomber Modification;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8709;Delivery of an atomic bomb required a plane with an enormous bomb bay and good payload. Special releases, guide rails so the tail fins of the bomb would not get caught in the bomb bay, additional crew stations to carry the technicians who would arm the bomb in flight, and, in the case of the B-29, even modifying the design of the plane to extend the length of the bomb bay, had to take place.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8710;U238 Reactor Prototype;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8710;This is a pilot nuclear power plant. The key objectives here would be to refine the reactor design and overall efficiencies of the plant so that more useful energy could be extracted from the plant than was consumed in the operation of the facility.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8800;Nuclear Weapon Testing;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8800;Weapons testing goes back centuries.  Swords and firearms routinely carried 'proof marks' that they had been built to standard and tested.  In the case of nuclear weapons, it was important that testing take place to verify the destructiveness of these unprecedented weapons.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8801;Uranium Detonator Construction;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8801;This is the construction of test of prototype Uranium guns so serial production of the shell of the Uranium Bomb (absent the fissile material) can commence;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8802;Uranium Bomb Test;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8802;Rather than consume the scarce U-235 in a live weapons test, Otto Frisch designed an experiment using Uranium Hydride where a mock-up of the gun and rings would be set up. Since the fission reaction in Uranium Hydride was slower than in the weapons grade U-235, dropping the bullet into the rings would result in only a burst of radioactivity instead of full explosion. Richard Feynman called it tickling the tail of a sleeping dragon and it became known as the Dragon Experiment.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8803;Plutonium Detonator Construction;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8803;This is the construction and test of working explosive implosion devices. In historical fact, this was the pacing item in completing the Plutonium Bomb that was used for the first man-made atomic explosion.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8804;Plutonium Bomb Test (Graphite);;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8804;This is a test detonation of an atomic bomb. In contrast to the Uranium Bomb, where calculations suggested a range of a factor of three in the potential explosive force, the estimates for a Plutonium bomb ranged from no effect to a slight chance that it could ignite the atmosphere and end civilization as we know it. Credible calculations suggested that the explosive force could vary by a factor of 10. Historically, this was the Trinity Test at Alamagordo, New Mexico, which resulted in an 18 kiloton detonation.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8805;Plutonium Bomb Test (Heavy Water);;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8805;This is a test detonation of an atomic bomb.

CTECN_N8806;Bomber Crew Training;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8806;This develops and trains the aircrew in the mechanics of loading and delivering an atomic weapon. It also involved learning to execute a special diving turn to maximize the distance between the aircraft and the bomb by the time it would detonate.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8807;U238 Reactor Prototype Testing;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8807;This evaluates the initial power reactor design and establishes the changes necessary for successful industrial or naval applications. ;;;;;;;;;;X

CTECD_N8808;Science was being transformed by the industrialization of knowledge creation and the formation of R&D labs where scientists could work together on high-cost, leading edge projects was a necessity that was gradually recognized around the world. This concentration of effort streamlined not only the work itself but also the procurement of political support and funding. For most countries R&D labs were only formed in the post-war years.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8900;Nuclear Weapon Production;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8900;Once weapons were tested, it was necessary to operate and assemble the new atomic bombs.  There were multiple types of atomic weapons which were available, depending on the type of fissile material used along with the method used to accumulate the nuclear fuel.  The field also received closer attention for other applications including as a source of industrial or motive power.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8901;Basic Uranium Bomb Production;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8901;After the bomb test is completed, serial production of the bomb can begin. These bombs have a yield of about 10 KT and are the same model that was dropped on Hiroshima (The Little Boy). Most of the materials are already in a production pipeline so this involves operating the bomb material industry, final assembly of the components, and transport of the actual weapons to the theater of war. The live bomb includes one additional feature. The fuse for the detonator is linked to a radar altimeter. Calculations show that the optimum blast damage will occur with a air burst at a certain altitude over the ground.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8902;Basic Plutonium Bomb Production (Graphite);;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8902;After the bomb test is completed, serial production of the bomb can begin. These bombs have a yield of about 20 Kilotons and are the same model that was dropped on Nagasaki (Fat Man). Most of the materials are already in a production pipeline so this involves operating the bomb material industry, final assembly of the components, and transport of the actual weapons to the theater of war. The live bomb includes one additional feature. The fuse for the detonator is linked to a radar altimeter. Calculations show that the optimum blast damage will occur with a air burst at a certain altitude over the ground.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8903;Basic Plutonium Bomb Production (Heavy Water);;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8903;After the bomb test is completed, serial production of the bomb can begin. These bombs have a yield of about 20 Kilotons and are the same model that was dropped on Nagasaki (Fat Man). Most of the materials are already in a production pipeline so this involves operating the bomb material industry, final assembly of the components, and transport of the actual weapons to the theater of war. The live bomb includes one additional feature. The fuse for the detonator is linked to a radar altimeter. Calculations show that the optimum blast damage will occur with a air burst at a certain altitude over the ground.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8904;Full Scale Nuclear Reactor Construction;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8904;Practical power plants may now be built.  These plants, suitable for land-based construction, provide useful amounts of power, but require no air to burn fossil fuels and only need to be refueled at extremely infrequent intervals.  This is a full scale plant that generates power.  However, the short development time of this plant is indicative of 'crash' development.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8905;Nuclear Propulsion;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8905;These are shipboard nuclear reactors that can be used to replace the fossil fuel powered propulsion systems on surface ships or submarines. ;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8906;Commercial Nuclear Power Plants;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8906;Now that the first full scale atomic plant has been built, additional plants may be built across the country. These are industrial power plants that provide electricity.  Once fueled, they operate for years producing no air pollution and without requiring transport of huge quantities of fossil fuel to the plant site.  These are copies of the first plant with few modifications or improvements.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8907;Tritium Bomb Design;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8907;Calculation showed that mixing a small amount of tritium with a ìcocktailî of Uranium and Plutonium might create an even more powerful bomb. Older, pilot nuclear piles can create enough Tritium for these designs.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8908;Tritium Bomb Testing;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8908;This involves the construction and test detonation of a Tritium-boosted atomic bomb. Historically, this took place in May 1951.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8909;Advanced Hydrogen Bomb Design;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8909;Reducing the theory to a practical design involved the use of electronic computers for calculations. However, there was a fundamental problem that the calculations kept showing that there was insufficient energy to push the tritium into a full-scale fusion reaction. A fundamental breakthrough was necessary to take this problem in a new direction.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8910;Improved Commercial Nuclear Power Plants;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8910;A second generation of atomic plants, incorporating the lessons of the first generation are now built.  These are industrial power plants that provide electricity.  Once fueled, they operate for years, producing no air pollution and without requiring transport of huge quantities of fossil fuel to the plant site.  The longer duration for the design and construction of these plants is critical to ensure their safe operation.  Historically, these were the first civilian power plants that were turned on the late 1950s.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8940;Semi-modern Nuclear Power;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8940;Improved nuclear weapons along with improved nuclear power sources are now available.  In addition, nuclear medicine, the use of radiation to fight cancers is more broadly developed.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8941;Semi-Modern Nuclear Power Plants;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8941;A third generation of atomic plants, incorporating the lessons of the earlier generations. These are industrial power plants that provide electricity. Once fueled, they operate for years, producing no air pollution and without requiring transport of huge quantities of fossil fuel to the plant site. The longer development time is driven by new safety measures that have been identified as critically important.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8970;Modern Nuclear Power;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8970;Nuclear weapons are reduced in size and/or increased in destructive force.  In addition, nuclear power plants are engineered for improved reliability and smaller size so they can be widely used in marine applications.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8971;Modern Nuclear Power Plants;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8971;A fourth generation of atomic plants, incorporating the lessons of the earlier generations. These are industrial power plants that provide electricity. Once fueled, they operate for years, producing no air pollution and without requiring transport of huge quantities of fossil fuel to the plant site. The longer development time is driven by new safety measures that have been identified as critically important.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8942;Fusion Device;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8942;The engineering problems for creating a thermonuclear explosion have been solved.  An atomic bomb detonates and creates a fusion reaction of tritium.  However, this device is the size of a small building and is far too heavy to deliver with a strategic bomber.  This is the device which was detonated at Eniwetok Atoll in November, 1952.;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECN_N8943;Hydrogen Bomb;;;;;;;;;;X
CTECD_N8943;The fusion device is miniaturized so that a strategic bomber can carry it.  Unfortunately, the designers of HOI don't have the hard code for this weapon so there is no new weapon here.  Historically, these were available from the mid-1950s.;;;;;;;;;;X

Is it the freedom of the German population of Danzig, which is not threatened, or is it a matter of barring Poland from the Baltic, from which Poland will not allow herself to be barred? (...) Two conditions are necessary for peace to be of real value: peaceful intentions and peaceful methods of procedure. If the Government of the Reich is really guided by those two pre-conditions, then all conversations are possible. (...) Peace is a valuable and desirable thing. Our generation, which has shed its blood in several wars, surely deserves a period of peace. But peace, like almost everything in this world, has its price, high but definable. We in Poland do not recognize the conception of peace at any price. There is only one thing in the life of men, nations and states which is without price, and that is honor.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_702130;After the war a port in Gdynia was created and soon it became the most modern and one of the biggest sea ports at the Baltic Sea. However, most of highly-industrialized Polish areas lay in the South: in Silesia and Zaglebie regions. Toll war of 1925 with Germany, and British miners strike of 1926, proved that Polish coal could be a valuable source of income - if only its' transport costs could be lowered. A new railroad line linking Silesia with Gdynia was proposed. The first short segments were opened in the late 1920s, but it wasn't until March 1931, when the construction really started at high speed. It was finished on 1st August 1935. Soon it became highly reliable and allowed Polish mines to bring greater income. Poland became one of the main suppliers of coal in the world - and one of the cheapest.;;;;;;;;;;X

During the Great Crisis, a Polish Coal Convention was established to control both the export prices and internal usage of the black gold, as it was called. To promote trade and gather money for further development of Polish industry the export prices were kept at a much lower level than in internal market. However, after the incorporation of Cieszyn Silesia the government decided that the newly-acquired coal mines did not have to obey the PKW regulations. This meant that approximately 25 per cent of Polish coal could reach the customers in Poland at a much lower price. A conflict with the PKW moguls started and soon a wave of miners protests spread throughout the country.;;;;;;;;;;X

The petition was not accepted and a wave of protests and riots soon started to spread throughout the country. By August 1937, the wave reached its peak when a 10 days long peasant strike was ordered by the Stronnictwo Ludowe party. During the strike that took place in almost every village in Poland the farmers denied any food shipment to cities, blocked railway lines and roads. The government decided not to intervene, but in several counties the riots were brutally pacified by the police and the army.

In December 1936, the Ludwikow Steel Mill (Huta Ludwikow) bought the Suchedniow Steel Factory near Kielce. Soon it was decided that the latter factory is to be turned into a motorcycles factory. The SHL motorcycle (named after the town of SuchedniÛw and Huta LudwikÛw company) turned out to be a huge success.

French military credit to Poland allowed the purchase of French tanks. Poland asked for Somua S-35 and Hotchkiss H-35, but France denied.

CEVTDESC_752387;With fall of Berlin, and the general defeat of our German allies, the war is drawing to a close. Our defeat seems certain, in the face of the invincible Allies and the Red Army. Historically, the fall of Berlin and death of Adolf Hitler led to massive retreat of remaining German and NDH troops. The troops fled towards Austria and Italy in hope of reaching western Allies to surrender to them instead of soldiers of Yugoslav army, thirsty for revenge, or the approaching Red Army. Poglavnik Ante Pavelic and most of the Ustashe leadership fled Zagreb and attempted to hide in South America but were eventually found and brought to justice in the newly formed Federal Democratic Republic of Yugoslavia.

MacArthur had a deep affection for the Philippines--he had spent much of the inter-war period on different assignments in the Philippines, However, he had no choice but to obey and leave. MacArthur arranged for himself, his family and a small military entourage to escape on four PT boats of Lt. John Bulkeley's Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron 3, and then by B-17 to Australia.

Major problems, with the funding requirement for the Armyís creation, expansion, basing and equipment being one of the most intractable challenges. 1936 had been devoted to the building of camps, organization of cadres, and the special training of instructors. The first group of men was called up on 1st January 1937. However, the vast majority of the Army would be reservists.;;;;;;;;;;X

This command, to be called U.S. Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE), would consist of the Philippine Department, those military forces of the Commonwealth ordered into active service, and such other forces as might be assigned. At the same time, Gen. MacArthur was recalled to active duty and put in command of U.S. Army Forces in the Far East. The recall of Gen.

With its present strength, he pointed out, there was a real doubt in the Philippine garrison could resist an attack. To strengthen the garrison and increase its chances of holding Luzon and especially Manila Bay, Gen.

CEVTNAME_322398;The Death of General Andrews;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_322398;In February 1943, as wartime Commander of the U.S. European Theater of Operations, General Frank Andrews launched the American strategic air campaign against Germany. Before he was killed in an air crash along the Icelandic coast, he had the central role in directing operations intended to achieve victory in Europe. His outstanding knowledge of every phase of airpower was an invaluable asset to the Allies in the early stages of planning and executing the combined British and American 'round-the-clock' bombing offensive against Germany. It is difficult to speculate about how great a role General Andrews would have played during World War II and later, if he had lived. His significance, however, does not depend on what 'might have been.' Instead, it rests on the unique contributions he actually made in his lifetime.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_9604;Britain offered a peace agreement to the leaders of the victorious rebellion in Yugoslavia. The treaty respected Yugoslav sovereignty and self-determination.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_9603;The Yugoslav monarchy had been too decadent for a long time. Regent Pavle did not have the support of certain sectors of the Army, and was not popular amongst the general population. When he buckled to German pressure and signed the Tripartite Pact to join the Axis, the group of nationalist officers headed by General Simovic knew that it was time to make their move. Few rebellions were executed with less complications. The Prime Minister was arrested by police and forced to resign. Regent Pavle was forced to sign his abdication, and the same night went to exile in Greece. The public was ecstatic: the streets in Belgrade were full of people singing and waving English and French flags everywhere. The German minister in Belgrade was publicly insulted;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_9602;Massive demonstrations against our signature of the 'Pact of Steel', entry into the Axis, led by a wide coalition of opposition parties, have shaken the government. Hundreds of thousands of protesters have taken to the streets, chanting 'Better War Then Pact', 'Rather Grave Than Slave', and 'Out With The Government'. With the help of British diplomats, generals of the Air Force Borivoje Mirkovic and Dusan Simovic have accomplished a coup d'Ètat against the current government. Teenage King Petar II has been named head of state, while general Simovic has named himself Prime Minister. The people are rejoicing on the streets, while the German ambassador has been spit on and was seen leaving Belgrade. The new government will attempt to placate the Germans with trade concessions and further negotiations about military access. Yugoslavia, a country until then poorly governed, had shouted its heroic, but temporary, defiance at the most powerful conqueror of the modern era.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_952094;As the China incident escalated into full-scale war the internal Chinese rivalries were gradually put aside.  Although the warlords of China continued to be at odds and corruption remained a great problem, there was also many political moves to defeat a common enemy.  Throughout the war, Muslim fighters from Sinkiang fought alongside the KMT forces and gained a reputation for being among the best forces in China.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_952093;Many Koreans had fought for the Communist forces during the decades of conflict in China.  As war erupted in their homeland these veterans returned to North Korea, still with Chinese army equipment and ready to fight for the Communist cause.

CEVTDESC_952088;The joint trusteeship ultimately failed to defuse the international and domestic pressures in Korea.  The country was destined to be torn apart and ravaged once more as war broke out between North Korea and South Korea.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_952087;As all major powers agreed to joint trusteeship, the future of Korea was decided.  The North came under the influence of Communism while the South became a Capitalist outpost on the Asian continent.  The decision was vastly unpopular with the Korean people and once more popular unrest swept across the country.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_952086;As foreign governments moved in and established their rule over the Korean people the KPR government was destroyed and many expected a return to the days of colonial rule.  Massive unrest followed despite investment in rebuilding by the occupying power.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_952085;The ravages of war had displaced much of Korea's population and destroyed local industry.  The rebuilding was slow and often hampered by banditry and lack of materials.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_952084;After more than 30 years of colonial rule, Korea won their liberty when Japan conceded defeat.  Gradually local governments started forming and rebuilding from the chaos of the war began.  This became known as the KPR government.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_952075;The imperialist Japanese forces are no match for our forces. We have destroyed an enemy column and seized much equipment from them, learning much in the process.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_952065;In a daring surprise attack our brave soldiers have acquired much equipment from the corrupt warlord forces! We have learned much from this.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_952064;During the long struggle with the corrupt warlord forces, we have learned much about warfare. Now that there is a pause in the conflict we should strive to improve our defensive position, to implement the changes proposed by our German advisers and also to reform our military.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_952063;In 1940, Mao came up with a new political program in his 'New Democracy'. It was a flexible regime based on an alliance between the working class, peasantry, lower middle-class and the 'national capitalists'. The program stimulated the proliferation of small industry and handicraft production (through industrial cooperatives, or 'Induscos'), and improved the economic situation of the peasantry. At the same time, Mao instituted a severe auto-critique on Communist China.

CEVTDESC_802070;After Spanish civil war Mussolini sent aid to Spain to rebuild the country. It was officially given to help the Church of Spain, so it was a good diplomatic move that pleased the Vatican and the rest of Europe. It was very useful to Italy to keep Spain as friendly and close as possible because of the obvious strategic advantages of having a possible ally in the Mediterranean. Even as a non-belligerent, the idea of having bases in Spanish territory was very seductive for Mussolini. Historically, Franco used that help from Italy to rebuild the Spanish Church, as intended, but also to build the huge 'Valle de los Caidos', a spectacular and monumental mausoleum for the national, Italian and German soldiers killed during the war. It was also where Franco was to be buried after his death.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_802059;The Allies wanted to strangle the German economy through any means at their disposal. After instituting several measures to limit trading between neutral countries and the Axis, the Allies finally decided to block all of Germany's foreign trade. Portugal was considered by the Allies as an adjacent neutral, and as such subject to severe trade restrictions. Imports of critical supplies were limited to pre-war values, to avoid creating stockpiles that could be exported to the Axis. Meanwhile, the trade deals for tungsten and other Portuguese products the government kept making with Germany were making the Allies very displeased with Portugal. By 1944, patience had all but ran out, and the Allies demanded the complete cessation of trading between Portugal and Germany.

CEVTDESC_802054;During the war the amount of Portuguese exports to Germany grew. Germany needed minerals like tungsten, chrome and zinc, which Portugal extracted. The German people also needed fruit and fish. Germany found itself paying high prices for it's raw materials and foodstuffs. One example is tungsten. Tungsten (or wolfram) was very important in the production of hardened steel for armor plating, ammunitions and industrial machinery. After declaring war on the Soviet Union, Germany was cut off from the main production center of China, where it had supplied itself, and had to turn to Portugal and Spain for help. The Allies competed for the Iberian production, and the price of the ore rose quickly, going from $639/ton in 1939 to over $27,000/ton in 1942. In 1941, Germany managed to strike a deal with Portugal, in which Portugal guaranteed a stable price for tungsten. In exchange, German exports to Portugal would be made at 1938 prices.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_802053;In 1940, as war raged in Europe, Portugal commemorated what Salazar's government called the double centennial.

However, there was little support for Moroccan independence among Republican politicians, fearing the French reaction if the revolt spread into neighboring French Africa. Instead, Morocco was used as a bargaining chip in an attempt to gain the support of the western democracies.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_802035;Franco received nearly 2 million tons of oil on credit from the Texas Oil Company during the civil war.

CEVTDESC_802029;As the great fascist and communist powers took sides in the Spanish Civil War, the conflict came to symbolize for many the struggle between the two ideologies.

CEVTDESC_802027;The uprising reached Barcelona the morning of 19th July 1936, when General Fern·ndez Burriel seized key areas of the city in preparation for the arrival of General Goded from Majorca to take command of rebel forces in Catalonia. Throughout the day there was bloody fighting in the streets of Barcelona, with the resistance led by militias of the CNT (anarchist labor union), together with police forces still loyal to the government. By the evening of the 19th the attempted coup had failed, the remaining pockets of resistance finally surrendered in the morning of 20th July 1936. Goded was forced to announce over the radio that he had fallen prisoner and that further fighting was useless. The leaders of the Barcelona uprising were executed.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_802025;One of the main objectives of the rebellion against the Republic was to crush the nationalist movements in Spanish territory.

In National-held provinces it was forbidden to use local idioms (such as Catalan, Euskera or Galego), or show regionalist flags or symbols. Failing to obey those orders would mean imprisonment or even execution.

CEVTDESC_802020;The majority party in the Basque Parliament, PNV (Basque Nationalist Party) announced yesterday that their ministers and counselors would leave their seats in Central and Autonomic Governments. They said that they took this decision because the Central Government had forgotten about Euskadi, leaving it isolated and helpless after the fascist aggression. The demise of those counselors caused a big commotion, as it left the Autonomic Government useless due to PNV's majority in the chamber. This morning, the PNV, backed by nationalist militias (gudaris), dissolved the Autonomic Government and installed a new independent government declaring Euskadi an independent state that would continue the war against fascism with their own means.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_802019;Despite the fact that Poland pronounced full neutrality in Spanish Civil War and banned any arms export and volunteer emigration to any of the belligerent sides, polish state-owned factories sold several hundred thousands carbines and rifles to the Republicans.

CEVTDESC_802018;In 1937, the Catalan government approved a special economical plan, known as 'Tarradellas plan'. Josep Tarradellas was then the minister of economy of the Catalan government. The plan tried to solve the problems that the war had created. It gave great powers to the minister of economy for enforcing laws for war effort, for reorganizing the administrative and economical staff in Catalonia, for imposing new taxes and for helping in the collectivization of factories. The economical measures tried to progressively change a capitalist production mode to a more socialist one. The plan had considerable success in these areas, especially for war industries.

CEVTDESC_802009;During the Civil War, the Communist movement was very important to Republican Spain: International Brigades were created by the Comintern, and many militia forces were raised and commanded by communist leaders.

CEVTDESC_802002;The Spanish Civil War resulted in more than 500,000 deaths, not only on the battlefield. The Fascists, with a extermination policy imposed by the High Command, executed approximately 90,000 people. Cruelty, however, was present on both sides. Though the government asked its troops not to take reprisals, many angry militants took justice into their own hands.  7000 clerics were killed, and many falangists and enemy soldiers were executed. The land that was left for those who won the war was a land full of hunger, poverty, and dead bodies in ditches.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_802001;During, and after the war, thousands of people fled to the mountains to avoid the Franquist repression. Many of these refugees joined together, creating a guerrilla network in many Spanish territories. The guerillas attacked targets such as infrastructure, mines, falangist housing, but their primary objective was to survive. With the outbreak of war in Europe, the guerillas thought the Allies would bring their war against fascism to Spain, and therefore decided to help the Allies. This help came mainly in the form of information, but not exclusively: the mugularis, or passeurs, helped approximately 7000 Jews, spies, resistance members, and British pilots to escape from German-occupied France. Although the guerillas were never a serious danger to Franco, he was forced to commit a lot of resources and men to exterminate them.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_802000;Although no democratic country sent military help to the Spanish Republic, the pressure of public opinion, and the impact of the press showing the cruelty of the war, motivated some countries to sent humanitarian help. The Republic received ambulances, food, medicine, and medical personnel, as well as Red Cross volunteers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752487;We have received guns for our fortifications from the USA. This unexpected success is emboldening our people, and we can now stand up to fascist aggressors.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752486;As we expected USA has refused our offer and we will have to obtain the heavy guns needed for our fortifications elsewhere. Many in our government are very disappointed with this turn of events.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752484;Yugoslavia built fortifications along the Italian frontier and later along old Austrian, now German border but these fortifications lacked heavy artillery pieces to be effective. With Czechoslovakia and France gone, and UK under threat of invasion, the only neutral place left to buy artillery were United States of America. Historically, Yugoslavia offered its surplus of cement production to USA in exchange for guns but USA refused, failing to realize an opportunity to ensure neutrality of smaller nations in Europe.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752477;We have received a large shipment of powerful German tanks, including their assault guns, armored, cars, howitzers, anti-tank guns, and other miscellaneous equipment. This will significantly increase the power of our armored formations. Historically, in July 1943, Germany finally agreed to modernize Bulgarian armored force (the 1st Armored Brigade) and supplied it with 46 PzKpfw IV, 10 PzKpfW III, 25 Stug III assault guns and 20 Sd Kfz 222 armored cars plus necessary howitzers, anti-tank guns etc. In the end tanks ended up fighting its builder instead of the Red Army since Bulgaria switched sides in 1944.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752475;Germany has sent us 36 of their Pz Kpfw 35(t) tanks. This gift will significantly enhance our knowledge of tank technology. Many in our military feel that an alliance with Germany might be worth pursuing.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752472;We have obtained permission from France to purchase a large quantity of their excellent R-35 tanks, to improve and upgrade our armor units. Our old Renault FT-17 and M.28 tankettes are considered obsolete, and many officers clamor for their replacement. Historically, in 1939, 54 R-35 tanks were bought from France, arriving to Yugoslavia in April 1940. They replaced the old Renault FT-17 and Renault-Kegresse M.28 (Char de Combat Muni du Propulseur Kegresse-Hinstin M.27/28) tanks in the 1st Armored vehicles battalion (1. Bataljon bornih kola).;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752469;We are in negotiations with the government of Italy for the purchase of the SIAI Savoia Marchatti SM-79-I heavy bomber designs. Our general staff recommends that we purchase the design to give us some long-range bombing capability. Our Foreign Minister reports that this sale could also improve the relations between our country and Italy. Historically, Yugoslavia purchased SIAI Savoia Marchetti SM-79-I designs from Italy in 1938.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752466;The government of United Kingdom has provisionally approved a purchase of some Hawker Hurricane Mk. I fighter aircraft for our Air Force, as well as a purchase of the designs and a manufacturing license. These fighters have received favorable reviews by the RAF, and some of our officers believe they could significantly improve our short-range fighter defenses.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752464;The Germans have sent us enough Bf-109 E-3 fighters, supplies, and spare parts to equip two entire new squadrons. Training has started to teach our pilots how to use these new machines. Historically, negotiations which began as early as January 1938 finally came to a conclusion in 5th April 1939, with the initial contract to supply Yugoslavia with 50 Bf-109 E-3 and 25 spare DB 601 A engines. This was followed by another contract for a further 50 Bf-109 E-3 in June 1939, in exchange for the iron, chrome and copper ore, which was of vital importance to German industry. Deliveries had begun in autumn of 1939 but only 73 airplanes were actually delivered and the lack of spare parts grounded many of those.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_752460;Our military demands that we request this beautiful aircraft from Germans, even blackmailing them with canceling our regular ore shipments. While some are concerned that this could bring us closer to Germany, others are afraid of provoking the Germans with blackmail. Regardless, the Messerschmitt Bf-109 E-3 is certainly one of the most advanced designs in the world, and our Air Force would be very pleased to have some of those aircraft in its ranks.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752458;We have purchased the designs and the license for the Dornier Do-17K tactical bomber aircraft from Germany. These new aircraft should boost our tactical bombing capability significantly. Historically, two 1000 hp Daimler-Benz DB 600 A engines were replaced with two 960 hp Gnome-Rhone 14N1/2 engines. Yugoslavia built Dornier Do-17K bomber aircraft at the State Aircraft Factory (Drzavna Fabrika Aviona) in three versions: Do-17 Kb-1 tactical bomber, and the Do-17 Ka-2 and Do-17 Ka-3 reconnaissance aircraft with secondary bombing and attack capability.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752455;We are in a position to negotiate a purchase of a small number of Bristol Bleheim Mk I bomber aircraft from United Kingdom, our traditional allies. These bomber aircraft are needed to modernize our aging air squadrons, replacing the old Breguet 19 and Potez 25 in role of tactical bombers. We are also negotiating to purchase the license to build some more in our country, as well as designs themselves. Some officers, however, are against this purchase, calling it unnecessary. Historically, in 1936 Yugoslavia purchased 22 Bristol Blenheim Mk I tactical bombers from United Kingdom with a further 16 being built under license by Zmaj Factory at Zemun. They replaced the old Breguet 19 and Potez 25 biplanes in the tactical bomber role.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752453;Historically, in 1936, Yugoslavia purchased a number of Hawker Fury Mk II airplanes from the UK. Some were also license-built by Zmaj at Zemun and Ikarus. They remained in service with 5th Fighter Wing until the April war and claimed three Bf-109s and one Bf-110 for the loss of eleven Furies in aerial dogfighting.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752451;We are in a position to negotiate a purchase of a small number of Hawker Fury Mk II fighter aircraft from United Kingdom, our traditional allies. These fighter aircraft are needed to modernize our aging fighter squadrons, to enable us to compete with the new designs coming into service in other countries. We are also negotiating to purchase the license to built some more in our country, as well as designs themselves. Some officers, however, are against this purchase, calling it unnecessary.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752434;NDH had seven governments during its existence. The fourth lasted from 1st April 1943, until 11th October 1943. Milan Budak was named Foreign Minister, while Andrija Artukovic became Minister of Security.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752433;Following the capitulation of Italy, Germany has transferred control of former Italian possessions on the Adriatic coast to our government. All of Dalmatia is once again part of Independent State of Croatia. The people are rejoicing at this fortunate event.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752432;Former Italian conquests in the Balkans have reverted to our control. Croatians, our staunch allies, are clamoring for the return of Dalmatia and Adriatic coast, their claimed provinces. Returning these lands will remove the burden of their occupation from our hands, and increase our influence with the Croatian government. What shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752431;Italy has capitulated, and we are free from their domination. Poglavnik Ante Pavelic has proclaimed that we are free from Italian control, and that he will be taking personal control of the government and the country while Nikola Mandic will take over the post of the Prime Minister. We are currently hoping that Germany will take over former Italian territories in Dalmatia, so that we might commence negotiation on return of Dalmatia and the coast to Croatia.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752430;Croatian national Parliament, Hrvatski Sabor, was reconstituted today. The representatives were formed from the still living representatives taken from the last Hrvatski Sabor in 1918, Croatian national MPs from the Yugoslav Parliament, and from distinguished political activists in the Croatian national movement. This moves Croatia a step closer to international recognition and respectability. Historically, the Hrvatski Sabor was reconstituted on 23rd February 1942, and had about 200 representatives. Even though its role in the governing of Independent State of Croatia was limited, it did serve to legitimize the country in the eyes of the Western democracies.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752429;The newly-made oil wells in Croatia are now producing up to their full production capacity. It appears as if the sceptics were wrong and the oil reserves in this part of Croatia are in fact significant. Historically, oil produced in Medjimurje and other parts of continental Croatia was a significant source of oil for the German war machine in the later parts of the war.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_752426;The newly-made oil wells in Croatia are starting to gear up to their full production capacity. It appears as if the sceptics were wrong and the oil reserves in this part of Croatia are in fact significant. Next year's production should be even better. Historically, oil produced in Medjimurje and other parts of continental Croatia was a significant source of oil for the German war machine in the later parts of the war.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752425;The newly-made oil wells in Croatia have started producing some oil, but our experts now state that additional resources are needed to complete the production facilities and to finish the geological surveys. Oil production figures so far do not support these additional requests for material. However, there are still some hopes that a major oil deposit will be found and production increased by a large factor.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752424;We have an opportunity to explore alternative sources of oil, a crucial resource for our industry. Some small oil wells have already been found in the Medjimurje area near Croatian capital, Zagreb. It is possible that these wells are merely the tip of the iceberg and that further exploration for oil will reveal large reserves. This move would, however, entail investing considerable effort in upgrading the province infrastructure and creating new oil drilling platforms. What shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752423;NDH had seven governments during its existence. The third lasted from 10th October 1943, until 1st April 1943. Vilko Begic was put in charge of armaments industry.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752422;Croatians refused to send volunteers for our campaign against the Soviets, and they are now trying to make up for their cowardice by additional ore shipments. They seem only willing to support our struggle from afar, without shedding blood in the process. We shall see...;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752421;Since we didn't send any troops, we need to show our good faith to Germany in another way. Germans have requested additional shipments of our iron ore, and we are pleased to comply. Our government hopes that this will clear any bad will between us and the Germans.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752420;We have an opportunity to show off the courage of our troops to Germany. We can send a number of volunteers to join a German Army division in Germany, to be used against the Bolsheviks on the Eastern Front. What should we do? Historically, in 1942, a group of 'volunteers' was sent to Germany where 369th Infantry Regiment was formed and added to 100th Jager Division on the Eastern Front. The unit fought in several campaigns, before being destroyed at Stalingrad.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752419;With the opening of a new front against the Soviet Union, many volunteers are joining our glorious armed forces in the fight against bolshevism.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752418;Hungary sent its own negotiators to Rome to discuss the newly created Independent State of Croatia and its borders. Hungarians demanded and received Medjimurje and Baranja areas, small provinces on the north-western and north-eastern tips of Croatia, respectively.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752417;We have a chance to destroy the remnants of old Yugoslav apologists and their hired help. For decades they cooperated with Belgrade to keep us down. We can finally strike back. Historically, Croatian Peasant's Party (HSS) represented Croatian interests in Kingdom of Yugoslavia. It's platform was based on cooperation and coexistence with Serbs in a federal state. Ustashe leaders were at best contemptuous of HSS and wanted to be rid of it's politicians and supporters. To cement their hold on the newly created Croatian state, they banned HSS on 11th June 1941, and seized the assets of their members.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752416;Ustashe terrorists have received assistance from a foreign government, both in money and training. This raises a possibility of further terrorist strikes against our country in the future. Historically, Italy, Hungary, and Bulgaria assisted the Ustashe, while Italy and Hungary provided for their training camps in late 1930s.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752415;Having managed to assure Soviet leadership of our sincerity, we have been granted independence once again. We shall now fight alongside our Russian comrades as allies and equals.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752413;After the disastrous performance of Croatian army in late 1942 and early 1943, during anti-partisan offensives, Germany has sent us equipment and advisors necessary to reorganize our infantry divisions into more mobile brigade formations better suited for mountain warfare, which the partisans excel in.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752412;Soviet leadership has agreed to an alliance with us. We are making final arrangements for a cease fire with the Red Army and a peace agreement with the Allies has been arranged. Our troops are retreating from all our occupied territories, and we have promised to return to our pre-war borders. We can only hope that Soviets will choose to keep us as allies instead of purging non-communists from the country.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752411;After the disastrous performance of Croatian army in late 1942 and early 1943, during anti-partisan offensives, many in our government feel that we should lend a hand to our incompetent Croatian allies. Our advisors suggest that Croatian forces be reorganized and given the equipment for mountain terrain, where most of the partisans are located. Also, the unwieldy Croatian infantry divisions should be disbanded and reorganized into more mobile mountain brigades. Shall we assist our Croatian allies?;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752410;The Red Army is here! Our position has grown increasingly untenable. Our strategists do not expect our army to be able to repulse the Soviet onslaught. Germans are either unwilling or unable to assist us. As grave as our situation is, there is still hope. A part of our leadership believes Soviet Union might be open to peace negotiations, provided we offer to switch sides. What shall we do? Historically, with Soviet troops arriving at its borders on 9th September 1944, Bulgaria decided to change sides and join the winning team.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752409;During recent fighting with Greece, German troops seized the province of Thessaloniki. We have long staked our claim on the province and its port, a significant transport and naval center. Germans have shown reluctance to administer the area directly, and have handed over control to our troops. In return, we have established access rights for their troops and their ships.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752408;Slavko Kvaternik was an Austrian-Hungarian colonel in WW I. He declared the formation of Independent State of Croatia on 10th April 1941. However, at the moment, he is becoming somewhat of a liability because of his public arguments with the leadership of the Ustasha movement. What shall we do with him? Historically, Slavko Kvaternik formally withdrew from his political and military positions on 4th January 1943, due to a conflict with Poglavnik Ante Pavelic. He then retired to Austria. Later, he was forced to emigrate to Slovakia together with his son Eugen Dido Kvaternik because of problems with the Ustasha movement. He was arrested post-war and extradited to Yugoslavia where he was sentenced and shot in 1947.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752407;Vladimir Laxa was second in command of the ground forces of the NDH in April 1941. He was also the commander of all our ground forces since June 1941. In October 1941, he was transferred to the High Command of the Croatian Armed Forces. Laxa has fallen out of favor with our leadership, and is considered somewhat of a loose cannon. What shall we do with him? Historically, he remained serving with the High Command of Croatian Armed Forces till August 1942, when he was removed by order of Marshall Slavko Kvaternik and forcibly retired.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752406;In 1941, Jure Francetic, together with Rafael Boban, organized the 1st Ustasha Regiment, the infamous Black Legion, and became its first commander. Historically, as colonel (highest active Ustasha rank) he was sent on 22th December 1942, to take command of Lika operational area. During flight his aircraft had engine failure and was forced to land near village Mocilo near Slunja - area held by partisans. He died presumably on 27th December 1942, from wounds he received during landing and capturing. He was posthumously promoted to Ustasha krilnik (highest Ustasha rank, also held by Slavko Kvaternik).;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752405;Mihajlo Lukic was the commander of the Osijek Divisional Area, later Inspector-General of the Infantry. He was also the Liaison officer to the Italian II Corpo d'Armata for a short period of time. In December 1941, he was named the commander of the 3rd Sarajevo Military Area, but remained in this position for a very short period of time. Lukic is very outspoken with his opposition to sending volunteers to Germany for the Eastern Front. His public opposition is becoming an embarrassment for the government. What shall we do with him? Historically, Lukic was forcibly retired in February 1942, due to his boisterous resistance to the government allowing Croatians to volunteer for German units on the Eastern Front.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752404;On 14th September 1941, the most successful sabotage to date was carried out by communist resistance. Organized by Rade Koncar and Vojo Kovacevic and carried out by Slavko Markon, Joze Culjat, Blaz Mesaric, Nada Holjevac and Vilim Galjer, a large bomb was placed at the Zagreb post office, destroying the central telephone exchange and cutting many phone lines. C-in-C of Wehrmacht, South-East sector, reported to Berlin that the only phone line from Zagreb to Berlin had to be directed across Budapest.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752403;On 4th August 1941, Slavko Komar, together with six other comrades, attacked an Ustashe student company with bombs near the Botanic garden, leaving 28 wounded Ustashe. This attack demonstrated that the resistance against the rule of Ustashe was significant.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752402;In early July 1941, Milan and Dragica Dvorscak burned 60,000 meters of parachute silk at Buzan street in the capital of Zagreb. Not only did this act of sabotage destroy a significant quantity of important war material, but the act itself encouraged resistance against the regime.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752401;NDH had seven governments, the second of which was in power from 1st July 1941 to 10th October 1942. It had 13 ministers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752399;Negotiations in Rome with the representatives of the newly-formed Independent State of Croatia have gone well. Croatia has agreed to secede Dalmatia to us, fulfilling our territorial demands, while also agreeing to allow Duke Sapoleto to become King of Croatia, Tomislav II. We are now effectively in control of Croatia, while having also resolved a festering territorial problem. Hungary was also involved, receiving Medjimurje and Baranja from Croatia.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752398;Once created, the biggest problem Croatia faced was determining its border with Italy, who wanted another Italian Greater Albania. Negotiations were opened in Rome to determine the fate of NDH and to establish territorial borders between Croatia and Italy. Hungary is also involved as it has a claim on the north-western tip of Croatian territory. Historically, NDH kept some minimal independence by becoming an Italian puppet with Duke of Sapoleto becoming King of Croatia, Tomislav II. Croatia also surrendered Dalmatia to Italy, fulfilling Italian territorial demands, and promised not to create a navy of any kind. Hungarians received Medjimurje and Baranja, which they asked for.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752397;NDH had seven governments during its existence. The first one lasted from the arrival of Poglavnik Ante Pavelic to Zagreb on 15th April 1941, until 1st July 1941. Foreign Minister was Pavelic himself in the beginning, later to be replaced with Mladen Lorkovic.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752396;Croats welcomed their glorious leader Poglavnik Ante Pavelic, who returned from exile today. Pavelic has led the Ustashe organization for many years now, and is considered the most popular of Croatian nationalist leaders. He has promised Croatia progress and prosperity in the foreseeable future under his government.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752395;On the same day NDH was established, brother of Slavko Kvaternik attempted to take over rule in Crikvenica. The commander of Northern Costal Defense Sector of Yugoslav Navy, captain Mirko Pleiweiss, reacted quickly and with a small naval detachment arrested the conspirators. Few minutes later a brief firefight took place leaving most conspirators dead (including Petar Kvaternik) and wounding several Yugoslav Navy sailors. Captain Mirko Pleiweiss then successfully completed the evacuation or sinking of ships of the Yugoslav Navy from Northern Sector preventing their capture by Italian forces.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752394;In August 1941, the situation in Serbia become critical, as after German attack on Soviet Union a communist lead uprising put most of the countryside ablaze. Germans quickly established a much stronger government under former Yugoslav army minister general Milan Nedic and provided armament for expansion of existing police units.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752392;Constant rise in partisan activities and capitulation of Italy are raising concern in our government that a large army is needed to combat the enemy. However, the people are resentful of constant fighting, and forcing another mobilization will have a negative impact on morale. What shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752391;Germany has refused to acknowledge our protestations regarding the 'Pact of Steel' and our recent government change. Enraged by recent events, Germans have decided to declare war upon us, creating panic in our government and population. Our longtime allies, United Kingdom and France, have offered us assistance in combating the German menace. Any assistance would be greatly welcomed, as our General Staff claims we cannot hold against Germany alone.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752388;Governments of France and Italy have sent us about 250 of known Ustashe terrorists and sympathizers, who were hiding out in Western Europe. Finally we have a chance to destroy the leadership of the movement and prevent a serious political crisis before it develops. The Prime Minister believes that a series of public trials and incarcerations of those criminals will dishearten other potential recruits and disrupt their terrorist network.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752385;The accursed Croatian Ustashe nationalists have struck again, planting bombs, assassinating public figures, and fomenting armed rebellion against the government. Their campaign has diverted resources toward repairing the damage, and has caused much political chaos. Concern has been raised abroad about our stability.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_752377;An agreement on matters of government policy and cooperation was reached today between representatives of the Peasant Democratic Coalition, a Serbian government coalition, and Serbian United Opposition, the opposition party. The agreement hopes to create a unified government, confirm the principles of centralized development, unitary state, and sovereignty of Karadjordjevic royal dynasty, and guarantee political and civil liberties.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752375;We've signed a non-aggression pact with Italy. This treaty also involves a political and an economic agreement. We have undertaken to respect our common frontiers on land and on the Adriatic Sea. This diplomatic coup has shown to other nations that we are capable of resolving our differences peacefully. Historically, Count Gian Galeazzo Ciano of Italy and Premier Milan Stojadinovic of Yugoslavia signed the pact on 26th March 1937, in Belgrade.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752374;With the failure to reach an agreement and solve the Croatian question, riots have broken out in cities of the Banovina Hrvatska, a proposed semi-independent Croatian administrative entity within Yugoslavia. Angry citizens and supporters of Vlatko Macek and his Croatian Peasants Party are demonstrating en masse in Zagreb, Osijek, Split, Rijeka, and other cities. Croats are refusing to enlist in the military, causing a shortage of new recruits.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752373;The political crisis has finally been resolved today through the signing of the Cvetkovic-Macek Accords, which provide for the creation of the semi-independent Banovina Hrvatska on Croatian national territory. This new division of government will have autonomous powers over agriculture, commerce and industry, social and health policy, education, and internal security over its territory. Ivan Subasic is to head the new government of Banovina Hrvatska. Both sides hailed the agreement as the beginning of a new era in inter-ethnical relations in Yugoslavia. Historically, the Accords merely delayed the onset of violent ethnic conflict, which erupted during WWII.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752372;Vlatko Macek has been selected by the Croatian Peasants Party, and the newly assembled Croatian Parliament, to negotiate with the Cvetkovic government about the Croatian status in Yugoslavia. Cvetkovic government has declared that its intention is to seek agreement with the Croatians about full equality in state and government affairs.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752371;Alarmed by the increasing turmoil in the country and its political crisis, Regent Pavle Karadjordjevic is considering intervening and removing Milan Stojadinovic and his cabinet. Dragisa Cvetkovic, Regent's confidant and trusted follower, will be named as the new Prime Minister, and he will select his new cabinet, should we decide to remove Stojadinovic. Historically, Regent Pavle removed Stojadinovic and replaced him with Cvetkovic, whom he believed capable of salvaging the public trust in the government.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752370;All the newly elected Croatian deputies to the Yugoslav parliament demanded in a resolution that the great powers intervene in Yugoslavia to assure the Croats 'liberty of choice and destiny'. Even though the resolution did not pass as the majority government deputies did not support it, it generated a lot of publicity both home and abroad.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752369;Flinging accusations of electoral fraud, and demanding the democratic right to self-government, parliamentary deputies of Croatian Peasants Party refuse to take part in the parliament, creating a government crisis. Public pressure is mounting that something be done.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752368;The government has finally called for a general election, and the main contenders are the current governmental coalition, Yugoslav Radical Community, headed by Milan Stojadinovic, and the opposition coalition, United Opposition, centered around Croatian Peasant's Party headed by Vlatko Macek. The mood in the nation is mixed, without any clear direction. Historically, in a very close election, radicals got 54 percent, United Opposition won 44 percent, and Stojadinovic government remained in power.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752367;The government has deemed the current Chief of Staff to be insufficient to deal with the war effort. Therefore, they have selected General Danilo Kalafatovic to be new Chief of Staff and coordinate the army efforts. We hope that General Kalafatovic will lead the army ably and courageously.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752366;Following our unconditional surrender, German government has decided to annex our country directly to the Third Reich. We have no choice but to comply. This is our last official act as the government of Yugoslavia.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752365;Soviet Union has signed a Treaty of Friendship and Non-aggression with us. This will help allay fears created in our public by Germany's belligerent actions. However, even though we had asked for a clause allowing for military assistance in case of an attack, Soviet Union has refrained from such a treaty at this time.

CEVTDESC_752363;Following our unconditional surrender, German government has decided to create two new states out of our remaining territories: Independent State of Croatia, and Serbia. We have no choice but to comply. This is our last official act as the government of Yugoslavia.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752362;The civil war in Yugoslavia, started over a government crisis about signing of the 'Pact of Steel', is over. Yugoslav loyalists have finally surrendered, and our continued independence is assured. It is now time to take our rightful place in world affairs.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752361;Ravaged by a brutal war, dismembered by German attack, and disillusioned by Allied support (or lack thereof), Yugoslavia capitulated. Germany dictated the peace terms, being the most powerful among the belligerents. Historically, seeing an opportunity to demonstrate the power of the Third Reich, and reward its allies and sympathizers, Germany decided to divide Yugoslavia among its neighbors. Central parts of the country were given to Croatia, a staunch German ally. The Dalmatian coast was handed over to Italians, while the extreme south of the country was awarded to Bulgarians. Hungarians received Vojvodina, a small northern province, while the remainder of the country was occupied by Germans themselves. Germany also annexed Slovenia directly, while deciding to create a puppet state out of the remains of Serbia.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752359;The Serbian-led government majority has decided to defy Regent Pavle and enter into a state of open rebellion against him and his decision to sign the 'Pact of Steel'. Using a moment of weakness in the kingdom, Ustashe leader Slavko Kvaternik has used the moment to proclaim the Independent State of Croatia (Nezavisna Drzava Hrvatska). Croatian people are elated, as they feel independence at last, after centuries under foreign rule. Sabotages and clashes prior and after the proclamation have destabilized the Yugoslav government and the army. Some of the Army units have even decided to join with us. Numerous volunteers are flocking to the ranks of Domobrani, our newly-established defense force. The upcoming conflict with Yugoslav loyalists has inspired our masses. Our government is also negotiating with Germany, in order to ask for their aid against the Yugoslav loyalists, who dared defy the Third Reich.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752358;Emboldened by massive demonstrations in the capital against our entry into Axis, various rebel factions have started an armed insurrection against the lawful government. The Croatian nationalist faction supports our alliance with the Germans, and has formed the Independent State of Croatia. Serbian nationalists and the majority of the armed forces have taken over the capital and are preparing to retake the rest of the country, hopefully assisted by the Allies. Chaos and strife are spreading around the country as brothers take arms against brothers, and neighbors fight with neighbors. The grand experiment called Yugoslavia, the land of the South Slavs, has ended in strife and violence.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752357;While massive demonstrations against our entry into the Axis have rocked the government, two Air Force generals, Borivoje Mirkovic and Dusan Simovic, have attempted to coup the current government. Fortunately, forces loyal to the government have prevented their coup attempt and placed the conspirators under arrest, while the gendarmerie has quelled the protests in streets.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752356;Massive demonstrations against our entry into the Axis, led by a wide coalition of opposition parties, have shaken the government. Hundreds of thousands of protesters have taken to the streets, chanting 'Better War Then Pact', 'Rather Grave Than Slave', and 'Out With The Government'. With the help of British diplomats, generals of the air force Borivoje Mirkovic and Dusan Simovic have accomplished a coup d'Ètat against the current government. Teenage King Petar II has been named head of state, while general Simovic has named himself Prime Minister. The people are rejoicing on the streets, while the German ambassador has been spit on and was seen leaving Belgrade. The new government will attempt to place the Germans with trade concessions and further negotiations about military access. Yugoslavia, a country until then poorly governed, had shouted its heroic, but temporary, defiance at the most powerful conqueror of the modern era.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752355;The government of Yugoslavia stands on the brink of disaster. The recently signed entry into the Tripartite Pact is opposed by the majority of the population.

CEVTDESC_752351;We have been offered entry into the Tripartite Pact, either through alliance with Germany, or through allowing their military safe passage over our soil ('Pact of Steel'). Our Minister of Foreign Affairs reports that the Germans are very keen on our signature of the treaty. Signing the treaty, in either version, will remove the threat of invasion, for which we are not ready. However, we risk alienating our population and our traditional ally, England. On the other hand, should we refuse, we face the imminent threat of an attack from Germany and her allies.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752349;Bulgaria, our eastern neighbor, has allied with Germany. Given their unreasonable claims on the south of our country, and their belligerent behavior during the last round of Balkan wars, we suspect they have pretensions on our soil. Our intelligence has determined that German Army units have been spotted moving through Bulgaria. Recent world events are giving rise to fears that perhaps an attack on our country from several directions is being prepared. The government is preparing contingency plans and readying supply stockpiles.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752347;We have signed a treaty of peace and perpetual friendship with Hungary, hoping to discourage their government from attacking our country. Even though the treaty promises peace and good relations, tensions still remain given Hungary's ties to Germany.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752345;Fighting in Greece has led us to believe that some sort of relief is necessary, or else the Greeks might collapse. Our general staff has proposed that we ask France to send an expeditionary force to Thessaloniki, as they did in the Great War, to assist the Greeks and take the pressure off our southern flank. The Foreign Ministry, however, is unsure that such a move is wise at this time, due to the situation on the western front.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752344;The great Zenica Steelworks have finally been completed and are ready for production. Historically, the Steelworks opened in mid-1937, and were the largest such plant in Eastern Europe at the time. The plant helped Yugoslav steel export industry, made possible the production of modern armament, and employed thousands of workers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752343;In March 1936, Krupp's concern received contract to turn Zenica iron foundry into a modern steel mill capable of armament production using advanced metallurgical technology. The granting of the contract was favored by portions of the military, and led to closer connections between Yugoslavia and Germany. The completed Zenica Steelworks became one of the largest steel mills in Eastern Europe.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752342;In only nine months, shipping tycoon Bozo Banac built an aluminum factory in Lozovac, which became the first producer of aluminum in this part of Europe. The factory was later confiscated by Italians after their occupation of Dalmatia. After capitulation of Italy the factory was plundered and anything of value was taken to Italy. It was rebuilt in 1945, and confiscated again in 1946, by the new Yugoslav communist government. The new factory was recently returned to the only heir, Marko Ivanovic, whose family also owned a large part of Yugoslav oil industry.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_752315;Athinai has fallen into enemy hands, and the enemy is overrunning our defenses. We are preparing for our last stand at Crete, where the government has taken refuge. However, the government of Britain is offering to take over Crete as their territory and to shelter a government-in-exile. Additionally, they are offering to garrison Crete with their units and bolster its defenses. Should we accept, we have been given guarantees that when the war shifts back to our side, that Greece will be liberated from its occupiers. Alternatively, we can attempt to hold Crete against all opposition on our own. What shall we do? Historically, Greece reluctantly handed Crete over to Britain when it became obvious that mainland had fallen and that the country was as well as gone, in late April 1940. British rule over Crete was short-lived, however, because a daring aerial invasion of the island by Luftwaffe paratroopers expelled the British expeditionary force after two weeks of bitter fighting.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_752200;In February 1941, General Metaxas, dictator of Greece suffered a massive heart attack and died. The strains of leading the country since 1936, and the struggle against first the Italians, and now the Germans took its toll on the venerable leader, and he passed away.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752199;The United Kingdom has sent us the promised aid to fight the Italians.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752198;Upon the commencement of hostilities with Italy, General Metaxas made overtures to London for aid in his fight.  Building on the stated declaration of a guarantee of Greek independence, Metaxas argued his case forcefully.  Britain, and her Commonwealth allies, sent arms, munitions, and additional forces to Greece.  Though in a losing cause, Britain increased her standing in Greece by these actions.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752197;When the Italian leader Benito Mussolini issued his ultimatum to the Greek government in October 1940, the response was swift and clear.  General Metaxas, the Greek dictator, issued a one word reply to the Italian demands: OXI!  Oxi, or Ochi, simply means no.  Following that reply, the Italians launched an invasion of Greece on 28th October 1940, from their holdings in Albania, and met stiff resistance.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752196;After banning all political parties except his Monarchist Party, General Metaxas pursued other means of stifling opposition to his rule.  In the wake of the 1936 general strike, and the farmer's agitation, Metaxas made further opposition to his rule effectively illegal.  As a consequence, almost all of the active political opponents of Metaxas were exiled, with many fleeing to Cyprus, Crete, Lebanon, France, and Britain.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752195;In the aftermath of the labor unrest the previous year, and in an attempt to boost his own support, General Metaxas initiated a plan to ease the burden on Greek farmers.  The plan called for price raises for agricultural products, and the government in Athens assuming most of the farmer's monetary debts.  Metaxas did all this, yet failed to win any popular support, but some dissent was alleviated by his measures.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752194;With the unrest of the May strike, and continued challenges to his authority, General Metaxas forced through legislation banning all political parties in Greece.  The legislation was a mere rubber stamp on his fiat which had the effect of forcing all opposition parties underground.  Only Metaxas' Monarchist party remained legal.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752193;Following the electoral problems in April, the various unions and trade guilds staged a general strike beginning in May 1936.  General Metaxas, the Prime Minister, instituted a state of emergency, and cracked down on the strikers, and the unions.  He used the state of emergency to further enhance his own powers, becoming a more identifiable dictator.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_752192;In March 1936, the Greek elections produced a split result, with Panagis Tsaldaris and Themistoklis Sophoulis locked in a heated battle.  As neither candidate was acceptable to the King, Ionnes Metaxas was appointed Prime Minister on 4th April 1936.

CEVTDESC_752183;Germans have invited us to a state visit to their country. This is an opportunity to gain assurances from German government about their intentions in the Balkans, especially concerning our country. What shall we do? Historically, Prince Paul, the Regent of Yugoslavia, paid a state visit to Berlin where Chancellor Adolf Hitler guaranteed the inviolability of Yugoslavia's borders in a state toast. Such guarantees were historically proven false less then two years later when Wehrmacht invaded and conquered Yugoslavia, in a campaign lasting less then two weeks.;;;;;;;;;;X

During the 1926 he became the C-i-C of all forces loyal to Pilsudski. As the commander of the Colonial League he was the main air force and navy proponent in Poland. He died in a plane crash over Gdansk Bay on 16th July 1936. His RWD-9 crashed into the sea after Orlicz-Dreszer wanted to greet his wife on her route home onboard 'M/S Pilsudski' ocean liner. His funeral in Gdynia became a huge patriotic manifestation.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_702122;We have managed to negotiate a purchase of the design and a manufacturing license for the Landsverk L-60B light tank from Sweden.

A few tankettes were lost in a brief two-day border war with Slovakia in March 1940. These tankettes were soon to be surpassed by basic light tanks, and did not see much use.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_702119;In 1938 Hungary began production of Landsverk L-60B Swedish light tank under license. The tank was named after a famous Hungarian hero from the XIV century. Historically, the Toldi I tank was used in Operation Barbarossa, the German attack on Soviet Union. However, it's minimal main gun (20mm) proved inadequate against heavy armor of Soviet tanks. Toldi I ended up being used mostly in a scouting role due to its great speed and excellent suspension.;;;;;;;;;;X

However, as the war was nearing the Polish Air Force needed modernization. This process encountered many problems. The main issues were lack of home-made aviation engines, German sabotage and lack of understanding of modern warfare among the politicians. Moreover, France and Great Britain were reluctant to fulfil the credits granted to Poland. In February 1939, Rayski resigned his post as a protest to constant quarrels about funds for the modernization.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_702116;Wincenty Witos was one of the most important politicians in the inter-bellum. As a member of Austro-Hungarian parliament he opted for a complete independence of Poland. After WWI he was a MP and Prime Minister and created Polish agrarian movement (Polish Peoples Party). Ousted by Pilsudskis coup d'Ètat, sentenced to 1.5 year of prison, he emigrated to Czechoslovakia. He returned to Poland in 1939, and lead the agrarian party until his death.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_702115;In the 1930s, the economical crisis touched all social groups, but the most impoverished were the farmers. Most governments after Pilsudski's coup d'Ètat either ignored peasant parties or did nothing to change the fate of the farmers. Polish agrarian movement had always been mostly democratic, but second half of the 1930s, saw increasing radicalization among peasant politicians and leaders. In August 1937, Wincenty Witos organized a huge peasant strike in central and southern Poland. For ten days, most of Polish farmers refused any food shipment in order to force Slawoj-Skladkowski's government to start democratization and let the exiled opposition leaders return to Poland. In certain areas a peaceful strike turned into battles with the police, in which almost 50 people were killed.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_702114;Roman Dmowski was one of the greatest and most controversial statesmen in Polish history. He represented Poland in Russian Duma. He was the main opponent of Pilsudski's plan of a big, multi-national country in the early days of polish independence. His idea was to create a small but nationally pure Poland that would assimilate all the minorities. After the WWI, Dmowski represented Poland at the Versailles conference and was the main ideologist of the national-democratic movement. Contrary to what most people think the two creators of Poland, Dmowski and Pilsudski, met personally only once - by accident on the street in Tokio.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_702110;Wojciech Korfanty was one of the greatest Polish politicians before and after the First World War. He fought for Poland in Reichstag and Prussian Landtag. After WWI he became a civil commissar of Silesia and prevented third Silesian Uprising from spreading into a full-scale war. He was a member of several parliaments, one of the leaders of Christian Democrats and a man of great valor. It's a great loss to our country.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_702109;Sikorski's coalition government turned out to be a relatively good cabinet. It managed to bring some political stability and relative prosperity. It also managed to win several Ukrainian groups to the idea of a multi-national state by granting them more rights and preparing a plan of an Ukrainian canton in southeast Poland. Kwiatkowskis 6-year plan, although not as radical as it could be, finally diminished the unemployment and opened a new period in which the differences between industrialized western voivodships and the rural and backward eastern voivodships were to disappear. Last but not least, it ended antagonisms between two main factions in Polish politics created by Pilsudski's coup d'Ètat in 1926. However, the clouds were gathering in the west and war was not impossible anymore.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_702108;Slawoj-Skladkowski's government turned out to be one of the best cabinets the Republic had. The minorities at last gained some influence and the government managed to bring back some political stability. Kwiatkowski successfully ended the economical crisis, diminished the level of unemployment and started a chain of necessary reforms. Although the voting laws were not entirely democratic and parts of the opposition declared a boycott of 1938 elections, more than 67 percent of Poles took part in the voting. This gave the government necessary support, as the official government party (Alliance of National Unity - OZoN) gained 57 percent of seats in newly-elected Sejm. However, the clouds were gathering in the west and war was not impossible anymore.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_702107;In 1936 the crisis after Pilsudski's death was over.

The most important problem was still the economical crisis after the 1929 Wall Street disaster.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_702106;The Polish government, exposed to German eastward expansion, sought closer relations with the Soviet Union by renewing the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact.

CEVTDESC_702098;In a speech in the Reichstag, Chancellor Adolf Hitler officially renounced the Anglo-German Naval Treaty of 1935, which had restricted the German navy to one-third the size of the Royal Navy, as well as the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1934, accusing the British and Polish governments of attempting to encircle Germany. Chancellor Hitler also renewed his demands on Poland regarding Posen and Danzig and offered bilateral non-aggression pacts to the Scandinavian and Baltic states. In response, the Polish government gave up its demand of a proposed guarantee from Russia and now supported British efforts to attract the Soviet government into a new peace front.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_702096;Colonel Adam Koc organized the Camp of National Unity, an all-embracing coalition of political organizations which supported the Polish government. The organization's goals included maintenance of the 1935 constitution, popular support for the army to protect the republic, anti-Communism, land reform for the peasants, and Polonization of minority groups. In response to this effort, workers and peasants formed the Workers, Peasants and Intellectual's Group, opposed to Koc's nationalist goals. Peasant strikes spread across the country and the government responded with bloodshed.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_702095;Following the peace terms from the first World War, the city of Danzig and the surrounding areas had been declared a free state protectorate under the League of Nations. As Hitler's power in Germany grew he started terror and propaganda campaigns in both Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Danzig in order to gain the support of the local German populations. The increasing pressure from the German minority in Danzig forces us to try and make an agreement with them to stop the violence in the streets and keep it from spreading into the rest of Poland. Such an agreement will greatly increase the influence of the nationalists in Danzig and diminish the power of the League of Nations in the region. This is what the nationalists want but we need the harbor of Danzig in order to keep our sea trade going.;;;;;;;;;;X

As a result, Warsaw uprising started with few well equipped assault units and many more trained people waiting for weapons.

CEVTDESC_702059;As the Red Army was advancing from the east, the German occupying forces were perceived to be on the defensive in Poland. Polish Home Army (AK), directed by the Polish Government-in-Exile in London, was eager to prove that Poland still had an army and a legal government. It was extremely important to counter Soviet attempts to install puppet governments as well as gain support of UK and USA for post-war period. Warsaw Uprising was part of the plan 'Burza' (Storm) - large operation of partisan units supporting advancing Red Army and installing local administration cells on liberated territories. At that point Germans had a comparatively small military presence in the Polish capital.

CEVTDESC_702054;Ukrainian National-Democrat Union (UNDO) was the main Ukrainian political party in Poland. From the beginning of its existence it was clearly anti-Soviet, but in the early 1930s, it also became strongly anti-Polish. It maintained relations with Ukrainian underground organizations, including the terrorist Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN). However later in the 1930s, UNDO made it to the Sejm and started to seek some sort of a modus vivendi with the government in Warsaw. An agreement was signed (historically in late 1936) in which UNDO promised not to continue the anti-government propaganda while the government stopped all repressions aimed at Ukrainians. This agreement became the beginning of a new era in Polish-Ukrainian relations.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_702053;After the battle of Warsaw in 1920, Poland looked ready to march on Moscow but Lenin sued for peace and the Allies pressured Pilsudski to stop his troops. At this moment two main ideas on Polish eastern borders emerged: the one proposed by Roman Dmowski and the one proposed by JÛzef Pilsudski. Dmowski wanted a state as large as possible without any national minorities while Pilsudski opted for a federation of nations in the pre-partition style of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The borders established at the treaty of Riga were a compromise between these concepts, and Poland after 1921 had around 30% of national minorities. At times the earlier concept gained the upper hand in certain areas and lead to major strikes and riots, especially among the Ukrainians as such politics were clearly aimed against their national aspirations.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_702052;One of the main issues of Polish internal politics in the 1930s was the case of the Ukrainian university. Both sides saw the need to create such a facility, but Polish government feared that setting it up in LwÛw would drastically change the national stability in the city and proposed a smaller city like StanislawÛw or Tarnopol instead. Ukrainians however feared that such localization would help the authorities to marginalize its role.

CEVTDESC_702048;After Poland regained independence in 1918, the boundaries between the former occupants were still clearly visible. Poland was informally divided onto industrialized and developed 'Poland A' and the rural and poor 'Poland B' which was on former outskirts of the Russian Empire. In February 1937, the government started to build the Central Industrial Zone (COP) between the Vistula and San rivers. The purpose was to develop the 'Poland B' sector, give a boost to the war industry and reduce unemployment. By 1939 a huge steel mill in Stalowa Wola, munitions factory in Sanok, carbines and handguns factory in Radom, aircraft works in Mielec and RzeszÛw and several other factories were constructed.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_702047;In 1936, an increased demand for grain enabled the Polish economy to fully recover from the Great Crisis. However the unemployment was still rising and government was forced to seek new solutions. In June 1936, Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski, the minister of economy, prepared a plan of government investments for the next four years. According to this plan hundreds of thousands of people were to be hired for construction of heavy industry and infrastructure improvements. Until 1940 more than 1.8 billion zlotys (almost 350 million 1939 dollars) were spent for that purpose.;;;;;;;;;;X

The Soviet attack rendered these plans obsolete - the government and all available military forces were forced to cross the Romanian border to avoid capture by Soviet troops. Between the 17th and 20th of September, over 40,000 troops, as well as most of the Polish Air Force, crossed the border into Romania. After disarming the troops, the Romanian government helped the Poles reach France and the UK - effectively recreating the Polish Army in the West.;;;;;;;;;;X

Fearing that another radical president would lead to revolt, especially if led by Almaz·n, Carden·s backed his defense minister, Miguel Avila Camacho, instead of his friend and fellow radical Francisco Mugica, writer of the more radical parts in the Mexican Constitution of 1917. Camacho was more moderate and had the support of the army through his brother, a high ranking general in the army.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_602013;In order to broaden his political power base, Carden·s reorganized the Partido Nacional Revolucionario (National Revolutionary Party (PNR)). Whereas the Party's power base used to lie with the military, the new PNR, now called the Partido de la Revolucion Mexicana (Party of the Mexican Revolution (PRM)), based its power on four sectors: labor, agriculture, the military, and the people. The CTM union represented labor, while the CNC union agriculture and the popular sector were represented by government employee unions. In this way the PRM controlled the vast majority of voters: most Mexicans were represented at least indirectly by this political party. Private enterprise was excluded from the PRM as it often opposed Carden·s program. Instead it was reorganized into the Chambers of Commerce and Industry. These Chambers represented the interests of both entrepreneurs and industry through lobbying, but were not granted the power to directly influence PRM politics.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_602012;In the second round of land reform, Carden·s expropriated the land held by foreign (mainly American) investors. This enraged conservative circles in the United States and added power to the oil industry lobby's proposal to invade Mexico. The Roosevelt administration, having had close ties with Carden·s, refused to consider this and instead only demanded compensation.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_602011;After the first round of land reforms, two more were to follow. One of those finished off the remaining Haciendas left after the first round.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_602010;In 1937, when the cotton workers went on strike, Carden·s reacted by nationalizing all cotton producing haciendas and turning them into ejidas: communal farms. This action had the advantages of increasing his popularity, reducing the power of the labor union in favor of the agrarian unions, and providing the impoverished peasantry with a source of income. In addition, the Ejidal Credit Bank was created to help finance the new ejidas. However, the price of nationalization was not cheap. Hacienda owners had to be compensated, significant starting capital was needed for the bank, and agricultural production dropped with these drastic changes. This event marked the start of Carden·s land reforms in which a total of 18 million hectares (49 million acres) would be redistributed.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_602009;In June 1937, Cardenas nationalized the Mexican railways and control was given to a cooperation of workers. This measure was popular with the people, yet some expertise was lost.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_602008;In November 1936, Carden·s imposed a new law, empowering the Mexican government to seize private property when necessary for public and social welfare. This law cleared the way for the massive land reforms of his term, as well as the nationalization of several other sectors. Foreign investors, however, regarded this law with distrust as it potentially threatened their investments.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_602007;Following the creation of the CTM labor association, Carden·s supported the creation of the Confederacion Nacional Campesina (National Farmers Confederation (CNC)). The CNC became a union association for the peasantry and farmers, giving them some political influence. In exchange, the state gained control over the peasantry.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_602006;After Calles was deported, conservatives in the state of San Luis Potosi rallied behind Calles and staged a rebellion against Cardenas. The military, however, remained loyal to Cardenas and quickly brought the revolt under control.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_602005;To pre-empt a coup by Calles, Cardenas sent a party of twenty soldiers and eight police to Calles hacienda. There they discovered Calles in bed with the flu, reading a Spanish translation of Hitler's Mein Kampf. More merciful than many previous revolutionaries, Cardenas contended himself with deporting Calles to the United States.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_602004;The existing unionist confederation in Mexico, called the Confederacion Regional de Obreros Mexicanos (Regional Confederation of Mexican Workers (CROM)), was corrupt and mistrusted. Lombardo Toledano, with support of Cardenas and the left-wing movement in Mexico, managed to unite several unions into the Confederacion de Trabajadores de Mexico (Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM)). This soon became the largest labor movement in Mexico and provided the state with a strong, centralized control over Mexican laborers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_602003;Stalin never forgot his enemies, no matter how long ago they opposed him, or how far away they were from the Kremlin. One of Stalin's most important enemies was Leon Trotsky, former creator and first commander of the Red Army, second in command under Lenin, and a founding figure of the Bolshevist movement. After losing the struggle for power after Lenin's demise, Trotsky was exiled from the USSR. He relocated from country to country, constantly tracked by Stalin's spies and assassins. Finally, in August 1940, he was killed by NKVD operatives in Mexico. Stalin's brutal action shocked public opinion both in Mexico and in the USA.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_552002;In 1936, after several years of negotiations and efforts to achieve a higher level of self-government, and with the pressure originated with the Italian invasion of Ethiopia, the United Kingdom finally agreed to sign a Anglo-Egyptian Treaty.

CEVTDESC_5204;The motives behind von Ribbentrop's plan for the conquered areas was simple - as foreign minister, he himself would have greater influence in a Europe of formally independent nations, as opposed to nations annexed to the Reich. He hoped for a world of make-believe diplomacy were the Foreign Minister of the Reich would always have the last word. Count von der Schulenburg on the other hand had been ambassador to Moscow, and perhaps better than anyone else understood the enormity of the task the Germans had set for themselves.

CEVTDESC_5200;Even before the beginning of the war in the East, there was debate between the Nazi higher-ups regarding the occupation and exploitation of the newly conquered areas. Two main alternatives arose: Himmler and the SS wanted a war of annihilation followed by ruthless exploitation of conquered territories and enslavement of the conquered peoples. The Soviet educated classes would be wiped out, and the remainder kept in the most abject poverty and ignorance.

CEVTDESC_5100;With Britain soundly defeated, it is time to replace the provisional peace with France with a more permanent European New Order. The Foreign Ministry has prepared a treaty in which Germany will keep Elsass and Lothringen and regain the colonies lost in the Great War, as well as some new colonial land. Iraq will become a Reich Protectorate. Italy will gain Malta, Cyprus, British and French Somaliland and Egypt as a puppet, while Spain will get Gibraltar. Occupied France will be returned to the Vichy Government and a puppet regime will be set up in London under Oswald Mosely. Ireland and Argentina will be offered the Ulster and the Falklands respectively, hopefully bringing them closer to Germany. Do you want to institute this New Order now?;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_492299;The threat of the Soviet Union was always a major factor in Japanese planning.  Recent events have forced a re-evaluation of defenses on some of the northern island chains and it's been proposed to send several labor battalions to begin construction of AA emplacements, coastal artillery bunkers and other defenses to improve the ability of the Army to hold these outposts.;;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_492298;With the developing threat in the Pacific theatre the Army has requested resources for construction projects on several islands and atolls.

CEVTDESC_492256;The inability of the Imperial Army in controlling the guerilla movements in China has finally reached a critical level and a major popular uprising is taking place in China.  Partisan units in several provinces have declared their loyalty to a single Warlord and he's called every man and woman to raise arms against the Japanese to win freedom once again from the 'foreign devils'.  Local garrisons in several provinces have been completely overrun and there's some reports indicating that the Chinese forces are receiving direct aid from Allied commando units.;;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_492234;The Japanese policy of maintaining only minimal garrisons in key cities gave the KMT and Communists a free hand in inciting villagers and townspeople in thousands of settlements against the Japanese occupation forces.  This quickly grew into a major resistance organization with significant clandestine aid from foreign powers and attacks on Japanese forces became a regular occurrence.  While some resistance groups operated in reinforced company strength and sometimes coordinated attacks within a province, there was no cohesive organization for forming units on the divisional scale or truly wresting control of entire provinces from the Japanese force.;;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_492223;Strong Japanese garrisons both in the cities and the countryside exerted a good level of control over the local populace, although inevitably there were some incidents every year where trouble flared up and required additional resources to quell.

CEVTDESC_492202;The Japanese policy of maintaining strong control only in the major cities gave the KMT and Communists a relatively free hand in inciting villagers and townspeople in thousands of settlements against the Japanese occupation force.  This would often result in strikes, attacks on police stations or other forms of resistance and as time passed insurgents sought to engage Japanese forces even within the largest cities with mortar attacks on barracks or sudden attacks on soldiers traveling alone.

CEVTDESC_492200;When the China incident first began few would have thought that Japan would one day extend control over all of China, yet this has now come to pass and our influence in Asia is growing as other governments acknowledge our strength.  The KMT has been reduced to nothing more than roving bandits and Japanese garrisons are being established all over the Chinese mainland.  It's critical that sufficient troops are maintained in China to prevent the KMT or Communist leadership from reforming and organizing mass uprisings against the occupation forces.;;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_492096;As Imperial forces advanced on Nanjing, Westerners fled the city like rats.  At Central China Army HQ, a member of Prince Yasuhiko Asaka's staff determines that the time has come for a demarche against the West.  Japan will show them that they are in China only with our sufferance.  Over two dozen aircraft attack and sink the USS Panay, an American gunboat on the Yangtze near Nanjing.  The US oil tankers nearby are also set ablaze and sunk.  An army gunboat approaches the sinking American naval vessel and rakes it repeatedly with machine gun fire.  The Foreign Office in Tokyo is aghast when they hear the news.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_492095;After the outbreak of the Chinese incident there was a gradual increase of U.S. economic and political pressure on Japan. The 'Hull note' that Japan received on 26th November, was regarded as an ultimatum that Japan could not accept and following a number of cabinet meetings, a strategy for war against Britain and the U.S. was agreed upon. Plans called for the conquest of the Philippines within 53 days, Malaya after 100 days and the East Indies within 150 days.  The neutralization of British and U.S. bases in the area was also a high priority.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_492094;After several days of battles involving more than 30,000 Soviet and Japanese troops, the fighting has now died down to a stalemate.

CEVTDESC_492082;While Japan originally faced few problems in occupying parts of China and Indochina they would gradually come under pressure from guerilla attacks.  Attacks on outposts, sabotage against supply lines and attacks on Japanese garrison units became common in the occupied territories.  In China, the irregular warfare was primarily by the Communist forces controlled by Mao Zedong while in Indochina it was the Viet Minh (who would later fight the French).  Due to the inability of Japanese forces to secure the vast territories conquered, the guerillas could always find a weakly defended target and their attacks were often quite successful.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_492081;With the new Chinese government taking orders from Tokyo, the time has come to fully assert Japanese control over the Chinese army.  Officers will be assigned to every Chinese formation to ensure discipline and control.  Chinese equipment will be replaced with superior Japanese technology and supplies, but as payment the Japanese governors will take control over Chinese industry and many industries will be moved to Japan.  Some ministers are arguing that a reduced program, limiting both tech transfer and industry relocation, will be less costly in the short term and less likely to cause dissent in China.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_492080;In June 1937, the Hayashi government fell and Konoe Funimaro came to power.  While he initially tried to balance the growing influence of the military, after the Marco Polo Bridge he became increasingly militaristic.  It was his cabinet that handed the conduct of the China Incident to the military, with no government oversight.  Konoe Funimaro would later conclude alliance agreements with Germany, issue the National Mobilization Law, establish the Shin Taisei and Taisei Yokusankai.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_492079;Ultimately the government of Konoe Funimaro failed to resolve the diplomatic conflict with the United States.  As tensions increased, Konoe Funimaro once more resigned and Tojo Hideki took over as Prime Minister.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_492075;Hamada was opposed to the growing influence of the military and the expansion programs.  When he gave his Harakiri speech it led to the resignation of the Minister of War, Terauchi Hisaichi, and eventually the fall of the Hirota cabinet.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_492074;Despite many calls for clemency, the government took a hard line with the conspirators and coup-makers of the 2-2-6 Incident.  Most of them were executed without trial, but ultimately this policy failed to stop the growing power of Kodoha-influenced officers in the Japanese government.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_492073;On 26th February 1936, Kodoha junior officers from units in the Tokyo area staged a coup d'Ètat.  In the early morning, 1400 officers and men embarked on missions to eliminate the political leaders of Japan.  Their victims included Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Saito Makoto, Finance Minister Takahashi Korekiyo and Army Inspector General Watanabe Jotaro.  Intended victims who escaped included Prime Minister Okada Keisuke, Grand Chamberlain Suzuki Kantaro, Prince Saionji Kinmochi and Count Makino Nobuaki.  The Kodoha forces seized control of key communications and administrative facilities and for several days the outcome hung in the balance.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_492072;The Kodoha (Imperial Way Faction) was a right wing association of junior and field grade Imperial Army officers.  They worked to dismantle the influence of political parties in Japan and to restore the Showa Emperor as an absolute ruler with the Army as his main instrument of policy.  The organization was influenced by political writers like Kira Ikki, Gondo Seikei and Okawa Shumei as well as the ideology of the Kokyrukai (Amur River Society).  Many of the Kodoha officers had little regard for democratic process and were prepared to use violence to bring the Emperor to power.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_492071;In April 1942, the National Finance Control Board was established under the Financial Control Organization Order.  The Board operated under the Bank of Japan and worked to strengthen government control over funding as well to establish central clearing systems for domestic exchanges.  They also brought more aggressive government involvement into the business operations of all financial institutions.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_492070;In February 1942, with the war against the USA underway, laws were passed to establish the Wartime Finance Bank and the Southern Development Bank.  Both institutions raised funds through bond issues and loaned it to military industries and various ventures such as hydro-electric generators, electrical power companies, shipbuilders and the petroleum industry.  The Southern Development Bank notes were generally used as military scrip and by the end of the war they had issued loans of 13 billion yen.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_492069;With the outbreak of war in Europe inflation levels started increasing throughout the world.  Increases in the levels of speculative investing using operational funds forced the introduction of the Banking Management Order.  This used the provisions of the National Mobilization Law to place all financial-institution lending activities under government control, including loans of operating funds that had previously been exempted from the Temporary Funding Adjustment Law.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_492068;With the outbreak of war in China, the Japanese government increasingly depended on bond issues.  From 1936 to end of 1937, the outstanding bonds increased from 685 million yen to 2,230 million yen.  This led to inflation and forced the government to impose stricter control on banks, foreign exchange and every other aspect of the Japanese financial systems.  In September 1937, the Temporary Funding Adjustment Law brought in even more controls, allowed for more bond issues at preferential rates and diverted funding and private sector savings into arms industries.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_492037;While the Soviet Union battled the advancing German army on the steppes of Russia, Japan was busy pushing back the Chinese army in mainland China: neither country could afford a second war front.  Japan initialized a neutrality treaty with the USSR that maintained a separate peace between the two countries, even though Japan was one of the Big Three and formally a member of the Axis.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_492033;Mexico has sent us a proposal for a trade deal. They would like to buy supplies from us in exchange for military supplies.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_492032;The Chinese leadership showed that they fully understood the concept of total war when they destroyed the Huayuankow Dike, causing a massive flood in the Yellow River area. Thousands of Japanese soldiers drowned and all military operations came to an abrupt halt, but the civilian destruction was immense.  Eleven cities and four thousand villages were destroyed, causing several hundred thousand civilian deaths and making millions homeless.  Years later, the people of the flooded provinces would remember the ruthlessness of the KMT and be among the first to rise up against the KMT when the Chinese civil war resumed.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_492031;As the China incident continued to escalate and Japan landed additional troops in north China, the Chinese army moved against the Japanese SNLF garrison in Shanghai. Fierce battles raged in the streets and the Japanese faced the choice between executing a hurried amphibious landing operation to relieve the beleaguered garrison or to evacuate Japanese citizens from the city.  Due to the size of the Japanese population in Shanghai an evacuation would be an expensive and difficult operation, with a high risk for civilian casualties.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_492030;As the China incident escalated to full warfare in northern China, Japanese authorities were no longer able to protect Japanese citizens in Tsing-tao against the anger of the Chinese people. In the face of increasing numbers of violent attacks on Japanese property and citizens, the authorities ordered a full evacuation.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_492029;Japanese garrison troops in Feng-Tai, southwest of Peiping, clashed with Chinese forces at the Marco Polo Bridge.

CEVTDESC_492026;Germany put considerable weight into negotiations with Japan over the recognition of Manchukuo. The Japanese government offered considerable trade concessions, including strategic materials critical to German industry. Signing of the agreement meant the end to German trade with China. Following the German recognition of Manchukuo, Japan committed to shipping strategic materials for use in Germany industry to make up for shortfalls from the cessation of Chinese shipments but historically the shipments were never made.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_462200;With the invasion of the Soviet Union, the fascist regime in Italy was able to whip up a frenzy of support for the Axis, even, and especially, from the Catholic Church which blessed soldiers as they left for the 'Crusade Against the Godless East'.

CEVTDESC_462137;Following the declaration of Croatian independence, the provinces comprising the mainland Banovina Hrvatska, a Croatian administrative entity, have been turned over to Croatia without a fight. As Banovina Hrvatska was in many ways a sovereign administrative body, controlled by a Croatian national majority, this arrangement will suit us greatly for the moment.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_462136;Negotiations in Rome with the representatives of the newly-formed Independent State of Croatia have gone well. Croatia has agreed to secede Dalmatia to us, fulfilling our territorial demands, while also agreeing to allow Duke Sapoleto to become King of Croatia, Tomislav II. We are now effectively in control of Croatia, while having also resolved a festering territorial problem.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_462135;We have an opportunity to return the Croatian nationalist Ustashe activists wanted for terrorism to Yugoslavia. They have used our country as a base for their political activity for a while, and now Yugoslav government is demanding that they be deported back to their country for processing.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_462134;Leaders of the Croatian nationalist Ustashe movement have asked us for financial support in establishing training camps for their paramilitary forces. Giving them aid will strengthen them and their campaign will likely destabilize Yugoslavia and please parts of our public. On the other hand, the ensuing diplomatic mess will be costly to clear up, and ignoring these malcontents might give us some influence with the Yugoslav government. Historically, Italy, Hungary, and Bulgaria assisted the Ustashe, while Italy and Hungary provided for their training camps in late 1930s.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_462133;We've signed a non-aggression pact with Yugoslavia. This treaty also involves a political and an economic agreement. We have undertaken to respect our common frontiers on land and on the Adriatic Sea. This diplomatic coup has shown to other nations that we are capable of resolving our differences peacefully. Historically, Count Gian Galeazzo Ciano of Italy and Premier Milan Stojadinovic of Yugoslavia signed the pact in Belgrade on 26th March 1937.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_462132;After Spanish civil war Mussolini sent aid to Spain to rebuild the country. It was officially given to help the Church of Spain, so it was a good diplomatic move that pleased the Vatican and the rest of Europe. It was very useful to Italy to keep Spain as friendly and close as possible because of the obvious strategic advantages of having a possible ally in the Mediterranean. Even as a non-belligerent, the idea of having bases in Spanish territory was very seductive for Mussolini. Historically, Franco used that help from Italy to rebuild the Spanish Church, as intended, but also to build the huge 'Valle de los Caidos', a spectacular and monumental mausoleum for the national, Italian and German soldiers killed during the war. It was also where Franco was to be buried after his death.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_462131;After Italy invaded Europe, England started on a major campaign in the League of Nations to have international sanctions imposed on Italy.  This behavior came across as extremely hypocritical to the Italian public;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_462130;After Italy's surrender in 1943, there remained pro-fascist Italian troops willing to continue the struggle on the side of Germany. Some 15,000 Italian volunteers spent a period of time training in the south of Germany, returning as the SS Legion Italia. Originally used in anti-partisan operations in February 1944, Himmler was reluctant to grant the unit full Waffen-SS status. But in 1944, when troops of the SS Legiona Italia distinguished themselves in action against the Allied landings at Anzio, Himmler proclaimed them full units of the SS. Later, the SS Legion Italia was granted full divisional status. Elements of the division lasted to the last days of the war, when having run out of ammunition, they unwisely surrendered to the partisans, who massacred the survivors to a man.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_462118;Adolf Hitler outdid himself on Mussolini's state visit to Germany in September 1937. Sensing the Duce's frustration over Italy's treatment by England and feeling an actual kinship with the Italian Dictator, Hitler treated Mussolini to five days of parades, rallies, and official visits. Hitler would even grant a request of Mussolini's to view the ultra secret armament factories of Krupp Steel. Even downpours and guffaws by the German military wouldn't sour Mussolini's mood. In the largest international media event of the time, millions around the world would hear Mussolini and Hitler surprisingly declare that Fascism and National Socialism were equal political movements in the Olympic Stadium. While the international community knew the day would come for a fascist alliance, the magnitude of the event hung a cloud of inevitability of war over Europe. For morale purposes, England would not transmit the event.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_462117;Benito Mussolini threatened to go to war with Germany if it proceeded with the imminent annexation of Austria in 1934. Strangely, this marked a major turning point in Italian politics that would come to Germany's advantage. France and England both failed to make good on their promises to support Italy and were seemingly willing to toss Italy to the wolves. Hitler backed down, and as the dust settled the Fascist Administration in Italy began to wonder why it was risking war for the seemingly impotent and scheming Western Powers. By 1937, Italy's international relations had done a 180 degree turn and German-Italian relations were at an all time high. Hitler took advantage of this by offering Mussolini a National Tour of his Third Reich;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_462116;In 1938, Benito Mussolini sent his loyal minion Riccardo Federici to the United Colonies of Eritrea, Somalia, and Ethiopia (known as the Africa Orientale Italiana) to report on the progress of the Viceroy of Ethiopia (then Emilio De Bono) in civilizing (i.e. industrializing) the colony for Italy's use. In a scathing report, he made it quite clear that there was a yawning gap between the promise of the empire and the actions of the men who had arrived at the colony. Incidences of corruption, exploitation, and infighting in the Fascist Administration were rampant.  Ordinary Italian settlers and soldiers were reduced to living in huts with the populace whilst money was squandered. Historically, Mussolini replaced Emilio De Bono with Pietro Badoglio as Viceroy;;;;;;;;;;X

All Mediterranean bases (except Gibraltar) will now be under our control and our claim on Saudi Arabia will be recognized. Jerusalem and Amman are also to be seceded to Italy. Egypt, Iraq, and Syria are to be reconstituted and their independence recognized by both Italy and England.

CEVTDESC_462113;Italy faces two problems: the alienation of the western nations and a new Independent State of Croatia forming between its new territories. Italy may be able to restore relations with the western nations by a partition of the remaining Yugoslav provinces with Italy's new neighbors. There are three disputed provinces currently under Italy's control: Pristina, Novi Sad, and Skopje. With regards to Croatia, the new country is still in its elemental state.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_462110;The College of Cardinals elected Engenio Pacelli as the new pope, Pius XII. He had served for several years as the papal secretary of state and chief advisor to Pope Pius XI. The new pope had a reputation for a strong will, an astute character, and diplomatic skill. Pius XII immediately set out to avoid a general war in Europe, but his efforts did not reflect a change in policy from Pius XI.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_462109;Pope Pius IX died at the height of European tensions between fascism, communism, and democracy. Pius IX gained an international reputation for standing firm against any regime which threatened religion or the rights of the individual. As a result, his policies often challenged the Communists and the Fascists.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_462104;The British and Italian governments agreed to mutually respect each other's interests and rights in the Mediterranean and the maintenance of Spanish independence and integrity. The British government hoped to end tensions in the Mediterranean region as Germany was emerging as a greater threat to European security than Italy. Despite this treaty, the Italians continued to support the Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War and the British were unable to prevent military supplies from reaching the belligerents. The British sought to use the non-intervention agreements as a means to prevent the expansion of the Spanish Civil War into a general war, but the Italians flagrantly violated this principle.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_462095;Although the Swiss government partially participated in the economic sanctions against Italy in response to the Ethiopian crisis, the government decided to recognize the Italian conquest. Fascist aspirations for incorporation of the Italian-speaking cantons of Switzerland, the conclusion of the Rome-Berlin Axis, and the collapse of the League of Nations collective security system persuaded the Swiss to avoid tensions with the Italians.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_462094;Pope Pius IX again condemned Communism in a papal encyclical aimed primarily at the Soviets and their campaign against religion.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_462093;Premier Benito Mussolini conducted an official visit to the Italian colony of Libya where he declared his interest and friendship for Muslims around the world. He permitted the Arabs to hail him as the protector of Islam and accepted the sword of Islam. This announcement challenged Anglo-French dominance over the Arab states and they accused the Italians of passing subversive propaganda in North Africa, Egypt, Palestine, and Syria.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_462092;While the import restrictions imposed on Italy by the League of Nations had only little effect on Italy's ability to purchase the needed goods, the bad publicity gained by the Italian campaign in Ethiopia had a great impact on Italian exports. This forces the Italian government into a dilemma. They can either try and boost the economy by devaluating the Lire or watch as companies go out of business. The Italian people felt that they were becoming increasingly isolated by the democratic powers in Europe and that strength could only be regained by drawing closer to Germany.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_462085;Despite the government line, the Italian Army was completely unprepared to wage a large scale modern war due to a multitude of logistical and organizational problems. However, as long as Italy was able to concentrate on only one front these problems did not manifest strongly, as shown by successes of the Italian Army in Ethiopia. As Italy found itself declaring war on more and more countries and opening up additional fronts in Yugoslavia, Greece, Africa and Russia, the problems began to manifest themselves with disastrous consequences.;;;;;;;;;;X

A few local Rases continued to resist and launch guerilla attacks on their conquerors.

CEVTDESC_462079;After stunning German success in France, Italy joined Axis and began aggressive moves in the Balkans and Africa. Mussolini's dream of new 'Roman Empire' was visibly at hand. As a part of this plan, Italy issued an ultimatum to the Greek dictator General Metaxas, demanding that he secede several strategic provinces in Greece, or face war (historically on 28th October 1940).;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_462076;In the years preceding the Second World War, many countries exported modern technologies to the USSR, thus contributing to the rapid industrialization of the Soviet Union. Even countries whose ideology was in extreme opposition to communism often decided to take the opportunity to earn money and influence from Soviet industrial development. Italy was one of these countries: their naval technology was vital to the development of the large Soviet Navy.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_462075;The German annexation of Austria posed a potentially great threat to Italian borders, despite the creation of the Rome-Berlin Axis. Mussolini's dilemma was whether to follow the demands of his people, who wanted to remain friends with the UK and France, or those of his fellow fascist dictator, Adolf Hitler, and the third Reich.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_462029;At the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, Mussolini sent some commanders as military advisors or leaders of specific units to Spain. In contrast with Germany, Italy didn't take as much advantage of the experience gained during the war, possibly because its intervention was much less of a decisive factor in the war. Tons of Italian weaponry were shipped to Spain, along with the means to manufacture them. If Germany had not shipped its weapons to Spain, Franco would have been forced to rely on Italian weaponry to win the war, and instead of the Mauser, Rebel troops probably would have been armed with Mannlicher rifles.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_462028;When the Italian armistice with the Allies was signed, the Germans established the Repubblica Sociale Italiana with the objective of continuing the fighting in Italy. German troops in the Balkans prepared to take control of Axis-occupied provinces. Most Italian forces in the region received the news of the armistice with optimism, wishing to receive orders to go home. Instead they were caught by surprise by the Germans. They were forced to turn their weapons over to Wehrmacht and SS units, and then were taken prisoner. Some units thought this was a dishonor to the Italian army and chose to fight against the Germans. Though a few soldiers and officers were able to escape and return home before being captured, most of the Italian Forces in the Balkans were imprisoned or executed.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_462027;On the night of 8th September 1943, as Field Marshal Badoglio, the new Italian prime minister, was signing a peace treaty with the Allies, German forces surrounded Rome and took over most of the northern provinces. Badoglio and the Royal family quickly fled to Allied territory while the Germans established a new puppet government in the controlled provinces. This was the Repubblica Sociale Italiana, under the nominal command of Mussolini, who was rescued from his imprisonment by German paratroopers. After that, half of Italy stood under the control of Germany and the new fascist regime, and the other half was in Allied hands. The situation dictated that Allied Italy would have to fight alongside Allied forces to retake its lost territory.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_462026;The desperation of Mussolini was an evident sign that fascist Italy was about to crumble and seek a separate peace with the Allies. Since the very first signs, the German High Command prepared plans to mobilize their troops in Italy to prevent the country from surrendering and to re-establish a fascist puppet government. On the night of 8th September 1943, as Field Marshal Badoglio, the new Italian prime minister, was signing a peace treaty with the Allies, German forces surrounded Rome and took over most of the northern provinces.

CEVTDESC_462023;The secret negotiations between Badoglio and the Allies eventually developed into an Allied final offer. The terms were harsh, but Italy was exhausted and had little choice. The treaty stipulated that Italy leave the Axis and sign peace with the Allies and the Soviet Union, return the prisoners on Italian soil, surrender all military arsenal weapons, and grant the Allies control over most of the country, establishing a military government. Obviously, Hitler was furious when Italy left the Axis, and the German troops on Italian soil, stationed in Rome and other important cities, tried to take over the country, but the defensive situation was desperate even for German forces. Finally, Badoglio signed the armistice on 8th September 1943, as Allied troops advanced deeper into Italian territory.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_462022;After the change of government in Italy, Field Marshal Badoglio immediately initiated secret contacts with the Allied powers in order to abandon the war and seek a separate peace. The Allies offered Italy a two-part surrender agreement;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_462021;After Italy had lost all its African colonies and the Allies were landing in Sicily, it was clear that the country could not continue the war. The Italian population was sick of it, the armed forces were demoralized and humiliated, and the economy was close to ruin. The long series of military disasters and defeats had ruined the credibility and popularity of Mussolini as a politician and as a leader. On 24th July 1943, the Great Fascist Council met and voted to retire Mussolini from the government. Following the Dino Grandi proposal, King Victor Emmanuel was restored to authority, bringing the fascist regime to its end. The proposal was seconded even by Ciano, Mussolini's son-in-law. The King assigned Field Marshal Badoglio to form a new government, Mussolini was arrested, and the first necessary measures to negotiate with the invading Allied forces were initiated.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_462015;The war against Ethiopia was not as easy as the Italian government thought it would be. The hard climatic conditions as well as the rough terrain were often decisive factors that the Ethiopians took good advantage of. Italy suffered a humiliating defeat by being expelled out of Africa by a poor, third-world country.  The Italian army appeared unprepared to fight a serious war. The Ethiopians demanded Italian dominions in East Africa in exchange for a peace agreement.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_462007;When Benito Mussolini took power in Italy, one of his first objectives was to resume plans to expand Italian influence in Ethiopia, thereby taking revenge for the humiliating defeat of the Italian army in 1896. The League of Nations voiced its disgust with this new war in Abyssinia, but did not take any serious measures to try to stop it. Addis Abeba was in Italian hands by May 1936. The Duce proclaimed King Vittorio Emmanuel the new Emperor of Ethiopia, annexing it into the emerging Italian Empire.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_462006;The once proud Italian colonies of Libya tumbled down after feeling the power of the Allied offensive in North Africa. Italian citizens in North Africa desperately tried to return to Italy, but many were captured by the Allies. Some of them even were killed by the furious Libyan people. The Italian army on the African continent was in very bad shape, and morale was very low. With the fall of Libya, Italy increased conscription to prepare for the potential invasion of Southern Europe by the Allies.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_432105;After the French government implemented a series of decrees aimed at improving the French economy at the expense of labor, the Confederation of Labor planned for a 24-hour general strike. To preempt the strike, the government militarized railway workers and requisitioned other services and threatened to deal harshly with any strikers. As a result, only a few workers went on strike, but many labor leaders were arrested. The government used national defense as the rationale to take sterner action against organized labor.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_432104;The French government finally passed a bill which devalued the value of the franc, although the legislation did not fix the franc's new gold content.

By 1943 the fear of German use of French Caribbean ports for their submarines and growing instability lead to U.S. demands for the French governors to switch to DeGaulle's side. On 2nd June 1943, a Gaullist coup in Guadeloupe failed, leading to a series of Gaullist riots on Martinique and, within a couple weeks, Guadeloupe again.

CEVTDESC_432004;During the 1930s, Polish military intelligence accomplished many feats in operations against the German Abwehr. Perhaps the most important was the creation of a copy of the Enigma encryption device by a small group of Polish math scientists: M. Rejewski, J. Rozycki and H. Zygalski. Their works provided valuable experience for the further development of decryption devices during World War II. In August 1939, Polish intelligence invited a group of Allied scientists to Kabaty Palace, a secret decryption research center, and handed over to them a copy of the German Enigma machine.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_432003;The victory of Franco and Nationalist Spain showed the world the horrors of Civil War without reconciliation. About 500,000 Republican Spaniards fled to different countries to escape reprisal. These reprisals were extremely cruel during the war: the Fascists had already executed over 90,000 people. Most of the exiled arrived at the border with France and were sent to immense camps for refugees. Extreme-right wing party members Maurras and Daudet criticized the decision to give shelter, and caused trouble with the negotiations. Fortunately, there were also people who sympathized with the refugees: pressure from public opinion and left-wing intellectuals made the French government decide to give shelter and food to civilian refugees, while militants could continue in the camps until they found a job or enlisted with either the LegiÛn …trangËre or Compagnies de Travailleurs …trangers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_432002;The Spanish Civil War became a war against fascism. Although France did not quite agree with Republican ideology, it was at least a democratic nation fighting against tyranny.

Heavy isolationist opposition made this almost impossible, and the issue came to a head in March 1941, when Wilkie gave his famous speech calling on Americans to ëopen their minds and hearts to the troubles of this world, and become the true Armory of Freedomí. It was a speech designed to minimize the backlash his programs of foreign aid would create.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_322016;The growing wars overseas frightened many Americans into calling for increased foreign aid and involvement. Fearing the Democrats would take advantage of the growing interventionist sentiment, President Landon gave his famous speech of March 1941, speaking out about the horrors of war and how America would prosper by staying out of it. To rousing cheers, Landon concluded with his famous line, ëLet the fools die, for our boys will stay home'.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_322015;The growing conflict in Europe convinced President Roosevelt that America had to get involved and bring its industrial power over to the side of the Allies. He explained these concepts in his speech in March 1941, referring to America as the 'Arsenal of Democracy'. Through force of will and gradual persuasion, Roosevelt increased American aid to Allied belligerents and slowly convinced more and more of the folks at home that war was inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_322014;The failure of government policies in the late 1930s increased social dissent and kept America firmly out of any foreign involvement. Emboldened by this growth of isolationist sentiment, the Republicans turned to Robert Taft as their presidential candidate in 1940. Condemning the mistakes of the past and of the New Deal, Taft sought to restore public confidence and wealth by going after corrupt businessmen and magnates, who he said 'were a blot on the American landscape'. Swept into office on a tide of public enthusiasm, Taft immediately went to work, proposed his first round of legislation, dubbed the 'Prosperity for the People' program, which was a series of laws criminalizing bad business behavior. The program was coupled with high protective tariffs and bans on arms exports.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_322013;World events of the late 1930s made many Americans question the wisdom of isolationism and the policies of President Landon. The mediocre successes of his Just and Fair Deal led many to wish for a return of the progressive Democratic legislation of the early 1930s. Campaigning in favor of an increased American role in world affairs, and bringing back some of the New Deal programs, Alfred Smith succeeded in winning a major electoral victory in 1940, defeating Alf Landon and bringing the Democrats back to power. The major part of President Smith's foreign policy was the reformation of the restrictive Neutrality Acts, passed in the early 1930s.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_322012;During the election campaign of 1940, Wendell Wilkie supported foreign policies that many critics pointed out were not much different than Rooseveltís. To distance himself from his opponent, Wilkie became increasingly critical of Roosevelt as a 'warmonger', portraying him as someone trying to get America into war as soon as possible. The success of this strategy prompted Wilkie to adopt increasingly isolationist positions as his lead in the polls increase. He adopted the famous slogan ëRepeal Rooseveltí, promising to restore the restrictive Neutrality Acts of the 1930s. Wilkie was elected by a large margin and had to consider fulfilling his promise.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_322011;Pleased by his repeal of the New Deal programs in the late 1930ís, isolationists rallied around Alf Landon, leading to a huge re-election victory over his Democratic opponents in 1940. Flush with success, Landon embarked on a new program designed to curb the power of the munitions companies, who were calling for loosening of the restrictive Neutrality Acts. With war looming in Europe, Republicans wanted to keep America out, and arms exports were seen as a dangerous way of getting involved in unwanted conflict. To prevent this, Landon proposed the Homeland Act, a program of restrictions designed to tighten, if not eliminate, arms exports outside of the country.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_322010;Roosevelt spent his second term in office revising the restrictive Neutrality Acts of the early 1930s, trying to slowly prepare American business for the conflicts that were looming in Europe and Asia. The adjustments to the neutrality laws permitted some forms of munitions exports, albeit less than what Roosevelt had hoped for. In the end, munitions manufacturers were satisfied with an opportunity to increase their profits by shipping more arms overseas. Roosevelt's re-election victory in 1940 made this transition complete.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_322009;After their electoral victory in 1936, the Republicans were eager to dismantle Roosevelt's social legislation. Fearing public backlash, they chose their course with care, debating between the gradual removal of each provision of the New Deal, or to eliminate the entire package in one bill of repeal. Pundits dubbed it the 'Just and Proper Deal', and it spelled the end of Rooseveltís legacy. Nervous investors watched carefully to see what the economic implications would be. President Alf Landon proposed the first of the bills in early 1937.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_322008;Although its legislation was passed in 1935, it was not until Roosevelt's election victory in 1936 that his 'Second New Deal' was considered permanent. It included such bills as: the Works Progress Administration Act, National Labor Relations Act, and the Social Security Act, and was designed to boost industrial production and put the great unemployed masses to work. The Second New Deal was economically a mixed success, but it did help restore the confidence of the American public as they eased their way out of the Great Depression.;;;;;;;;;;X

We've decided to proceed at any cost'.'But you'll have to kill half of the Spanish population!'.'I've said: at any cost!'. This is an excerpt of an interview with Franco by an American reporter a few months after the start of the war. The North American press was the main body responsible for showing the world the atrocities committed by both sides: the extermination policy of the Fascist side, and vigilante justice by Republican militias. Literary figures such as Capa or Hemingway, arrived in Spain, gaining much inspiration for their works. It was after observing the war that Hemingway wrote his famous novel: 'For whom the bell tolls'.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_272118;The British and Italian governments agreed to mutually respect each other's interests and rights in the Mediterranean and the maintenance of Spanish independence and integrity. The British government hoped to end tensions in the Mediterranean region as Germany was emerging as a greater threat to European security than Italy. Despite this treaty, the Italians continued to support the Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War and the British were unable to prevent military supplies from reaching the belligerents. The British sought to use the non-intervention agreements as a means to prevent the expansion of the Spanish Civil War into a general war, but the Italians flagrantly violated this principle.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_272113;The British parliament announced the marriage of Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson.  Mrs. Simpson is to be coroneted as queen to King Edward.  This is an obvious attempt to pander to right wing and pro-colonial elements in Britain, which does not bode well for the future.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_272112;Following consultations by London, the British parliament has decided that Edward can marry, but Mrs. Simpson will only be his consort.  It is obvious that Mr. de Valera's considered opinion was heeded not only by London, but across the Commonwealth as well.  The Irish government respects the decision of London.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_272111;Following various consultations, London has forced King Edward VIII to abdicate the throne in favor of his brother.  In true Irish fashion, de Valera delayed officially accepting the abdication for over a week, leaving Edward as King of Ireland for that period.  Taking advantage, de Valera passed several pieces of legislation, weakening the ties between Ireland and the Commonwealth.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_272110;On 10th December 1936, parliament made it known to King Edward VIII, that if he wanted to marry Wallis Simpson, he would be forced to sign an act of abdication, renouncing any claims he, or his heirs would have to the throne.  Edward signed the act, abdicating the throne in favor of his brother Albert (George VI).  Edward married Simpson, was made the Duke of Windsor, and moved to France, later moving to Portugal, before being made Governor of the Bahamas.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_272109;The British parliament was required by Commonwealth law to consult member states on matters concerning the Commonwealth as a whole.  As such, when the issue of Edward VIII's decision to marry arose as a matter of public debate, London sent three proposals to all the Commonwealth members: force Edward to abdicate if he wished to marry Wallis Simpson, accept Simpson as consort or accept Simpson as Queen.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_272108;As the situation revolving around Edward's decision to marry grew more and more intense, the British parliament was forced to act.  A decision was made, first by the cabinet, then by parliament as a whole, to find an acceptable solution, and restore stability to the monarchy as well as to the government.  As such, three options were put forward: force Edward to abdicate if he wished to marry Wallis Simpson, accept Simpson as consort or accept Simpson as Queen.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_272107;As time went on, it became quite apparent that Edward intended to marry Wallis Simpson, the American divorcee.

CEVTDESC_272098;Start of Warsaw uprising was sudden, but rather expected by UK. Much earlier Polish and UK governments decided that to support expected national uprising UK will train and support some special forces units. Ultimately these units took shape of some small diversion groups and one large unit, 1st Paradrop Brigade, lead by General Sosabowski. When uprising started, this unit was left in Britain due to high risk of air drop so far from Isles. Later Polish paratroopers joined 1st Airborne Army in Operation Market-Garden.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_272097;The start of the Warsaw uprising was sudden, but rather expected by UK. At the start British government hoped that Warsaw will be fast relieved by advancing Soviet forces, but Stalin's lack of support to the Polish Home Army (AK) action complicated the whole situation. The only way to support AK were air drops. Historically allied strategic bombers starting from bases in Italy and North Africa delivered huge caches of AT weapons, equipment and medicines to Warsaw, but due to the chaotic nature of city fighting over half of these were captured by German units.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_272096;As the Red Army was advancing from the east, the German occupying forces were perceived to be on the defensive in Poland. Polish Home Army (AK), directed by the Polish Government-in-Exile in London, was eager to prove that Poland still got it's army and legal government. It was extremely important to counter Soviet attempts to install puppet governments, as well as gain support of UK and USA for post-war period. Warsaw Uprising was part of the plan 'Burza' (Storm) - large operation of partisan units supporting advancing Red Army and installing local administration cells on liberated territories. At that point Germans had a comparatively small military presence in the Polish capital. The decision was based on assumption that Red Army is so close to Warsaw, that it will be able to join AK any day.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_272080;Immediately after the regime change in Italy, Field Marshal Badoglio, the new Italian Prime Minister, started the secret contacts to sign an armistice with the Allies. After some intense negotiations, it was evident that Italy was in a desperate situation and accepted the hard terms: leave the Axis and sign peace with the Allies and the Soviet Union, return the prisoners on Italian soil, surrender the arsenal and give the Allies control over most of the country, establishing a military government, shared between UK and the USA. At the same time that the armistice was signed, the German troops in Italian soil took over most of the northern provinces and established a new Italian fascist government, the 'Repubblica Sociale Italiana', ruled by Mussolini, who was rescued from his prison by German paratroopers.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_272077;After a stunning final victory over the German Wehrmacht, the Soviet Army continued pressing westwards. The Soviet Army at once started creating communist administrations and blocked efforts to bring legal governments-in-exile back to power.

CEVTDESC_272070;After Haile Selassie's flight to London the Italians found out that it would not be an easy task to pacify Ethiopia. A few local Rases were still resisting and launching guerilla attacks on the conquerors. A few submitted but as long as Italy did not have the Ethiopian nobility on her side there would be no peace in Africa Orientale Italiana. Mussolini tried to bribe the exiled Emperor with 1 million pounds and nominal sovereignty to satisfy the Ethiopian people's desire to be led by their Emperor, while keeping the actual power for Italy. Historically Haile Selassie I. declined. The Lion of Judah returned to power in 1942 invading his own country with the help of British forces from the Sudan. The world is watching, giving in to Fascist demands will reduce our standing and ensure Italian hegemony in Ethiopia. Defying the Fascists will increase our influence as we will be seen as upholding the rights of independent nations;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_272069;On 14th August 1936, The Irish Free State established its own national airline, Aer Lingus.  As part of de Valera's plans to further weaken Ireland's dependence on England, Aer Lingus was to be the new commercial connection between Ireland and the world.  This led to the creation of Dublin International Airport, and eventually to the creation of Shannon International Airport.  Trans-Atlantic service begins later in 1937, Dublin to New York.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_272068;As Ireland grew more confident in her independence, and in Eammon de Valera, it gradually moved further away from the Anglo-Irish Treaty that had established the Irish Free state.  After serving a term as Chairman of the League of Nations, de Valera began a more rigorous diplomatic program for Ireland, culminating in the External Relations Act (1936). Passed in the wake of the abdication of Edward VIII, it removed the British monarch from having any say in Irish external affairs, except for the accreditation of its diplomats.  By the end of the year, Irish embassies were present in several nations, and no longer dependant on the graces of the Commonwealth.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_272067;On the 14th June 1937, Irish voters approved a new constitution put forth the previous year by Taoisiech Eammon de Valera. Following on the heels of the External Relations Act and the abdication of Edward VIII in Britain, de Valera moved Ireland away from the Commonwealth and the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921.  The new state no longer acknowledged the King of England as the head of state (except for accreditation of diplomats), and instead instituted a new office, President.  Douglas Hyde was elected the first President of Eire in 1938.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_272066;With Britain at war against Germany, and the Blitz full on, many in Eire decided to seek work in Britain to support the effort against Fascism.  In total some 12,000 men and women went to work in Ulster and mainland Britain during the war years.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_272065;In the spring of 1941, with America sitting on the sidelines, the Royal Navy wanted the use of the Irish ports more than ever.  After several cabinet meetings, Prime Minister Churchill opted to do what had previously been unthinkable, offer the Ulster province in exchange for the Irish ports and full alliance between Eire and Britain.  Despite the offer, Eire rejected the request.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_272064;Since 1916, the Irish Republican Army (IRA) had been a thorn in the side of British authorities.  Even with the end of the Anglo-Irish War in 1922, the IRA continued to actively campaign in the Northern counties.  Raids on police stations, army barracks, and government buildings continued apace right up until the Blitz began in 1940, despite efforts by both the Irish Free State and Britain.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_272063;Beginning in January 1939, the Irish Republican Army (IRA), began a series of bombings not only in Ulster, but in mainland Britain as well.  An IRA bomb in Coventry killed 5 and wounded 70 in August 1939.  The campaign's highlight was the raid on the Magazine Fort in Phoenix Park which netted the IRA several crates of ammunition and guns, as well as provided a spectacular explosion.  The campaign came to an end in March 1940, as the German Blitz heated up, and bombs began to fall not only on Britain, but on Ireland as well.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_272061;In early 1942, U.S. officials approached the British government and Admiralty with an offer they had received from the government in Eire.  The Irish were offering the use of the Treaty Ports, but only if the U.S. Navy was in charge, no combat troops passed through Ireland (or Ulster), and no British troops or navy personnel landed on Irish soil.  The Admiralty told the Americans that the ports were no longer necessary, and to reject the offer.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_272059;After rejecting the British requests for the Treaty Ports, Eire decided to offer the use of the ports to the U.S. Navy in 1942.  Under the proposal, the ports would be under U.S. Navy administration, and no combat troops would be placed on Irish soil. U.S. officials jumped at the offer, only to reject it when the Royal Navy said they were no longer necessary to the war effort.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_272058;Though having been drawn into the European war, Ireland was at last united under a democratic and Irish government.

CEVTDESC_272057;The government of Eire accepted the final British offer for the use of the Treaty Ports.  As part of that agreement, His Majesty's government transferred control of the Ulster province to the Dublin administration, over the objections of pro-Union politicians in Ulster.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_272056;With Eire having rejected all offers and requests, the question was put to the British cabinet.  Take the ports by force, or struggle on with out them. Churchill and his ministers opted to move on, as getting involved in another conflict in Ireland was undesirable.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_272048;Fearing the rampant conquests of Germany, the Irish government decided that it had best make a decision regarding its safety.  In accordance with that, they accepted the Royal Navy's request for the Treaty Ports, in the hope that should Ireland be attacked, Britain and the other western Allies would come to their aid.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_272047;The immediacy of the situation in Britain led Churchill and his government to do what had been unthinkable.  Mainly, giving up the Ulster province to Eire in exchange for the Treaty Ports.  Despite the offer, and the achievement of a major Irish goal, de Valera refused the offer, unwilling to be drawn in to the conflict, and just as unwilling to help save Churchill.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_272046;The effects of the Anglo-Irish relationship since 1916, had long reaching effects.  Eire refused to allow the Royal Navy access to the Treaty Ports, citing her neutrality, and their desire to not be subject to any degree of British authority.  Especially as long as the six counties of Ulster remained under British dominion.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_272045;In 1940, the British government requested the use of the Treaty ports, 3 ports in Eire that had been under the control of the Royal Navy until 1938.  Eammon de Valera, Taoiseach of Eire, steadfastly wanted to remain neutral in the European conflict between Britain, France, and Germany.  Fearing that granting the British request would be seen as a hostile move by the Germans, and not wishing to give up what had been gained in Ireland, de Valera refused the request.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_272044;Begining in 1940, as the German U-Boats began to put a stranglehold on British shipping, some in the Royal Navy and government believed that by gaining the use of the former Treaty Ports in Ireland, they could break the Kreigsmarine in short order.  Churchill authorized contact be made with Dublin in regards to the ports at Cobh, Bantry Bay, and Lough Swilly.  The British cabinet held several options open regarding the ports, including taking them by force.  This was dubbed 'Plan W' by the Ministry of Defense, and envisioned quickly seizing Dublin and forcing a favorable response.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_272040;On 2nd September 1939, a day after the War in Europe had begun, the Taoiseach of Eire, Eammon de Valera made a clear declaration that Ireland would remain neutral in the conflict.  De Valera was supported by the vast majority of the population in Eire in this policy, even though many believed that the British fight was just.  As such, many thousands of Irish men and women went on to volunteer for either military service in Britain, or as workers in British factories, while their homeland remained out of the conflict.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_272039;In the middle of 1936, the Irish Free State government, under Eammon de Valera, passed legislation outlawing the Irish Republican army (IRA) in the Free State.  Prior to this, the IRA had been free to recruit, and drill in the Free State, despite having been declared an illegal organization in the North in 1922.  The passage of the bill in the Free State angered some, who still held that they could force Britain to relinquish the six Northern Counties by force if necessary.  Others saw this as a further betrayal by de Valera of his Republican principles.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_272031;As the Italians entered the capital Addis Abeba the Emperor had already left his country. He fled to Jerusalem first, then moved on to his London exile where he was hardly welcome. Many people criticized his move to leave the country but his main purpose was to appeal to the League of Nations again. In a speech in Geneva his conclusion was that if force was allowed to triumph over the Covenant, then the collective security of small states was threatened. Historically at this point the League of Nations became insignificant.;;;;;;;;;;X

During Japanese invasion, Aung San congregated all patriotic forces in the Antifascist League, a nationalist guerilla that fought against invaders. Once the Japanese were expelled, the struggle for the independence continued against the British, and in 1947, after conceding independence to India, it was absurd to keep control over Burma, so the United Kingdom was forced to grant a limited self-government status. Being Aung San was killed in July. His successor U Nu managed to get an agreement with Great Britain that established the right of Burma to get its independence. The new state Constitution was redacted and Burma began its official life on 4th January 1948.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_272027;The negotiations and processes towards the independence of India started after the popular protests and the Indian Congress demands arrived to their critical point. Since 1876, when Queen Victoria was proclaimed Empress of India, the country has been administrated by the British government. In 1935, after a series of conferences in London between British and Indian politicians, the British Parliament approved the Government of India Act. This gave some degree of self-government to India, but it remained a dominion of the British Crown, and that didn't fully satisfy Indian nationalists. After many years of protests like those headed by Mahatma Gandhi, independence has come at last. From this moment they will continue the fight against fascism and Japanese imperialism as a free nation and close ally of the United Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;X

Everything is ready for India to rule its own destiny and continue the fight against fascism and Japanese imperialism as a free nation and close ally of the United Kingdom. Many Englishmen are against this measure, as the India has been a part of the dominions of the British Crown since a long time ago, and during all this time we have administrated it with justice according to the important role it has in our economy and resource pool. Anyway, it is our compromise with history to decide the future of our dominions in the fairest possible way.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_272025;In August 1942, the Indian Congress voted a resolution followed by a non-cooperation movement that severely criticized the British imperialist attitude and demanded to negotiate the independence of India in order to continue its fight against fascist and Japanese imperialist aggression. In India, the discontent was growing due to the application of the 'Defense Agreement' between London and Delhi which stated that an important part of the Indian local founds were used to finance British war effort. There were even some factions like the one headed by Subhas Chandra Bose that thought that India should become a Japanese ally to liberate Asia from white people's hands. The British authorities reaction was immediate and very hard, more than 60,000 people were arrested. The popular protest, vigorous but spontaneous and without order, was repressed, and the national movement reduced to silence until the end of the war.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_272022;In May 1940, the political decisions of Neville Chamberlain¥s government until then in relation with the crisis and the subsequent war in Europe had proved themselves disastrous. Hitler fooled him in Munich promising that the Czech Sudetenland was Germany's last territorial demand, and Chamberlain returned to England assuring everyone that he had managed 'a peace for our time'. He also wasn't firm enough to protect Poland nor, more seriously, Norway. On 8th May 1940, as German troops crossed Holland¥s borders, a censure motion against Chamberlain was carried out in the Parliament. Through the motion did not succeed, it showed what little credibility the government had, so Chamberlain decided to leave his charge to somebody capable of forming a national government. In first place he asked Lord Halifax, but he declined his offer, so finally, the chosen one was Winston Churchill.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_222017;Josif Visarianovitch Stalin could not be called the most important of old date Bolsheviks - but he was definitely the smartest. His specialty was taking advantage of animosities between his adversaries. After seizing absolute political power over USSR he started to use this tactics to control NKVD, Soviet secret police. This way Yagoda, former chief of NKVD was succeeded by Yezhov, ensuring Stalin's control over growing power of apparatus of terror.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_222015;The mission of the RKKF - the Soviet Navy - had since the revolution been of a defensive nature. The shores of the homeland were to be defended mostly by submarines and minor surface vessels. But this policy would change. By the middle of the 1930s it was clear that Stalin was aiming for a large navy, a 'Blue-water Fleet', capable of projecting Soviet power outside of its home waters. An immense program was started, shipyards were extended and envoys were sent out to foreign countries. Their mission - to obtain plans and designs for battleships and large cruisers.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_222014;The victory of Franco showed the world the horror produced by a civil war without reconciliation. About 500,000 Spanish fled to different countries escaping from fascist reprisals, which were extremely cruel during the war - the fascists had already executed 90,000 people. Although most of the refugees went to France, many exiles asked for asylum in Russia, but the Stalinist regime made an exhaustive selection and only those who were considered the most faithful and devoted to communist ideology were allowed in, hardly 2000 people altogether.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_222013;Spanish Civil War became a war against fascism and Stalin couldn't watch as his communist comrades in Spain fought against Franco without helping them more actively. Russia sent military and political advisors as well as tons of weaponry with the possibility of converting Spanish factories to produce Russian weaponry.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_222012;After the fall of Poland Stalin was free to do anything he wanted in the Baltic zone according to the Ribentrop-Molotow Pact. As his goal was full control over all of the countries, he wanted to create an illusion of a friendly USSR. Vilnius (Wilno in Polish), historical capital of Lithuania and one of the more important cities in Polish culture, was a good example of these politics. Historically Vilnus was returned to Lithuania in 1939.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_222008;After having expelled the whole Polish army to British-held Palestine, Stalin decided to create his own Polish army in order to use it in his struggle to seize power in Poland after the war. Lend-lease shipments provided the newly formed units with arms and supplies, and Gulag-camps and NKVD prisons were the main source of the cannon-fodder. The only problem was the lack of Polish officers since Stalin ordered them murdered shortly before the Great Patriotic War started.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_222007;Despite the Sikorski-Mayski agreement, creation of a Polish army in the USSR met with several problems. The Polish government wanted to use the Polish army as one solid force, securing a future political system after the war. In contrast, Stalin was only interested in sending the newly raised divisions to the front one by one, as classic cannon fodder. Stabilization of the front lines also resulted in lowering Stalin's interest in creating a Polish army. As a result of these problems, the idea of withdrawing the troops to the British Middle East was welcomed with relief by both sides.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_222006;Three weeks after the Great Patriotic War started, an agreement was made between the Polish prime minister Wladyslaw Sikorski and the Soviet ambassador to the UK, I.M. Mayski, setting all polish citizens from the Gulags free and creating a Polish Army in the USSR.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_222005;We have signed a Treaty of Friendship and Non-aggression with Yugoslavia. This will help allay fears created in our public by Germany's belligerent actions.

CEVTDESC_2031;Ravaged by a brutal war, dismembered by German attack, and disillusioned by Allied support (or lack thereof), Yugoslavia capitulated. Germany dictated the peace terms, being the most powerful among the belligerents. Historically, seeing an opportunity to demonstrate the power of the Third Reich, and reward its allies and sympathizers, Germany decided to divide Yugoslavia among its neighbors. Central parts of the country were given to Croatia, a staunch German ally. The Dalmatian coast was handed over to Italians, while the extreme south of the country was awarded to Bulgarians. Hungarians received Vojvodina, a small northern province, while the remainder of the country was occupied by Germans themselves. Germany also annexed Slovenia directly, while deciding to create a puppet state out of the remains of Serbia. Do we proceed with the partition, or shall we take the country over completely?;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172332;Partisan activity in central Serbia and the resulting unrest have proved a continued drain on our manpower. With the war with Soviet Union, the military feels they need the occupation forces stationed there on the front.

It could cause a very tense diplomatic crisis that may even cause the war against them.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172318;In the first half (1939-1943) of World War II German economy worked at a slow pace, not switching entirely to 'war mode'. That was mostly due to the political reasons - Germany was apparently winning the war, so there was no sense in mobilizing the industry. All that changed in 1943, when Germany suffered some major defeats including capitulation of the whole 6th Army in Stalingrad cauldron and Allied landing in Africa. Facing combined forces of USA, USSR and UK Germans mobilized their industry by using workforce from occupied countries and redeploying production facilities to counter Allied bomber offensive. While very effective in terms of quantity, it also resulted in lower quality of the equipment and weapons.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_172303;The construction plan which was approved by Hitler and the Reichstag calls for the increased size of our submarine fleet.  Construction on the first submarines went well and it is now time for additional units.  These submarines should help the navy control the North Sea and prevent the Royal Navy from intervening in a future European war.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172302;The naval construction program approved by Hitler and the Reichstag calls for the expansion of the submarine fleet.  As a part of that plan, we are going to lay down the first submarines approved by the building program.  These submarines are going to be of our most modern design and should be able to control portions of the North Sea preventing the Royal Navy from intervening in a future European war.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172301;The navy has designed a construction program that emphasizes the construction of submarines over traditional surface warships.  Traditional naval thought says that a fleet with battleships, cruisers and destroyers is necessary to defeat the Royal Navy.  The British say that the development of ASDIC has made the submarine ineffective against protected merchant vessels.  Admiral Doenitz believes that the use of massed submarines will make it impossible for the escorts to effectively protect their charges.  Admiral Raeder has said that he will resign if the alternative plan is approved.  We could pacify Admiral Raeder if we submit a plan which includes some heavy warships into the mix.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172300;Admiral Karl Doenitz is advocating a naval construction program which will focus on the construction of submarines rather than surface warships.  He advocates that the submarine is the only weapon which will bring England to her knees in the event of war.  During the Great War, submarines came close to strangling the trade between England and the rest of her empire.  New submarine technology will be developed which will allow us to field a large, effective submarine force.  The plan is to build over two hundred submarines over the next eight years.  This will allow us to have almost one hundred submarines at sea at any one time.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172299;The navy has expressed doubt in Adolf Hitler's declaration that there will be peace until 1944.  This would give the navy the chance to complete an extensive construction program.  By expressing their doubt, the naval leadership has expressed an opinion that is shared by many leaders within the Wehrmacht.  If we maintain this course of action, it could create difficulties with the High Command which is loyal to the F¸hrer.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172298;The Z-Plan Naval Construction program which was approved prior to the beginning of the war called for the completion of a large, balanced fleet by the end of 1944.  This is the final scheduled program of warships that needs to be started to complete that program.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172297;The Z-Plan for naval construction that was approved before the war had a time table that would allow the completion of a large, balanced fleet before 1945.  All of the battleships that were planned have either been laid down or canceled.  The remaining elements of the fleet are cruisers and destroyers that are required to screen and scout for the heavy units.  There is also a carrier that is included with the program.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172296;The Z-Plan for naval construction that was approved before the war had a time table that would allow the completion of a large, balanced fleet before 1945.

This year's program calls for a large number of warships to be laid down.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172294;As a part of the Z-Plan, there was a requirement for the construction of a number of aircraft carriers.

CEVTDESC_172292;The support that we have given the navy has gone to improve the state of the navy over the years.  With the state of the world, it is advisable that we continue our support for the fleet.  The commitment of resources that this will require will be well used.  The Z-Plan naval construction program that was approved before the war called for the continuing construction of large warships like battleships and cruisers in addition to the supporting warships.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172291;The face of naval warfare has changed.  Surface warships are unable to survive in an area where land based aircraft are present without air cover.  The construction of an aircraft carrier would give the Kreigsmarine the air cover that is needed to operate in areas where enemy aircraft are active.  This carrier will be built to our most advanced carrier design.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172290;The Z-Plan naval construction program approved before the war called for a large investment in naval armaments.  The plan calls for the construction of a battleship and numerous cruisers, destroyers and submarines.  This plan is designed to increase the size of the navy by 1945.  This will benefit us in the peace following the war as we are forced to control defeated nations and assure the position of the German Reich.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172289;Hitler has maintained his promise that the country would not be at war.  This gives us the opportunity to complete the naval construction program that was contained in the Z-Plan.  The plan calls for the construction of one battleship, 2 cruisers and numerous destroyers and submarines.  The F¸hrer assures us that we will have time to complete this building program before we will be forced into a confrontation with France.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172288;The Z-Plan, which was approved by Adolf Hitler, was designed with the assumption that the country would remain at peace for the rest of the decade and into the next decade.  Unfortunately, aggressive policies by Poland, France and Great Britain have resulted in war across Europe.  Construction of heavy warships is not at the forefront of our priorities, but we will need a strong navy to rule the peace that will follow the successful conclusion of this war.  We can decide whether we want to start the construction of a new battleship and supporting warships, concentrate on small warships which can be built quickly, or focus entirely on the army.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172287;The Z-Plan, which was approved by Adolf Hitler, calls for the construction of a large number of warships over the next nine years.  The first segment of the plan was implemented earlier in the year.  The plan calls for the laying down of a second battleship.  Tensions in Europe are at a peak, but the F¸hrer assures us that the British and French will back down and we will have time to complete these ships.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172286;The Z-Plan for naval construction calls for warship construction to be spread out over the course of the next ten years.  The first ship to be laid down will be a battleship due to the long lead time on construction that is necessary.  This battleship will be of our latest design.  We are also planning on laying down two submarine flotillas and a destroyer flotilla to provide balance within the fleet.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172285;The naval construction plan, now known as the 'Z-Plan', was submitted to the Reich's Chancellor Adolf Hitler for his approval.  The naval construction plan calls for the construction of six battleships, 25 cruisers, four aircraft carriers, 14 destroyer flotillas and numerous submarine flotillas.  This new construction will enable us to control the North Sea and the Atlantic approaches.  With Hitler's approval, we can start planning for the allocation of the resources that are necessary for the construction of all of these ships.  If the plan is not approved, it will require us to close shipyards across the Reich due to lack of contracts.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172284;We have evaluated the original Plan X for its application towards the current state of affairs across Europe.  Although our internal evaluation states that a general war will probably start sometime in 1940, the F¸hrer assures the Obebefehlshaber of the Navy that war will not begin before 1944.  The plan that has been developed calls for the construction of a balanced fleet that will be able to challenge the Royal Navy's control of the North Sea and provide access to the Atlantic Ocean.  The plan calls for the construction of battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers and destroyers over a ten year period.  This will make the German Navy one of the largest navies in the world.  Admiral Doenitz has developed an alternative plan which will focus primarily on the construction of submarines and small warships.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172283;The signing of the Anglo-German naval limitation treaty in 1935 set the size limits for the German Navy.  Because of new construction by the Royal Navy, we can expand the size of the fleet.  The Reich's Chancellor, Adolf Hitler, assures us that any potential conflict with the Western Powers will not occur before 1944 so we will have time to complete an extensive building program.  We will be revising the plan developed by Captain Werner Fox.  Captain Fox's plan takes into account the amount of tonnage that we have been allocated under the naval agreement.  Captain Fox's plan is also known as 'Plan X'.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172282;As a result of the naval limitation treaty that we signed with Great Britain, the Reichstag approved funding for the construction of two new battleships.

CEVTDESC_172279;It appears that there are difficulties in General Blomberg's new marriage.  Rumors are going around alleging infidelity and some illicit photographs of his new wife.  This could prove to be an embarrassment to this government because the F¸hrer was a witness at the wedding.  We should be proactive about this situation and dismiss General Blomberg from his post and reorganize the leadership of the Wehrmacht to prevent this from happening again in the future.  If we fail to deal with this promptly, some of our more morally conservative officers could be offended and could cause problems.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172258;An organized partisan unit has struck at our railroad network in the Balkans, causing significant damage to the infrastructure near Zagreb, and causing several shipments to be delayed. We suspect the communists to be behind this revolting attack. Historically, the first partisan unit organized in Yugoslavia was assembled in mid-June 1941, and struck the rail network in a series of sabotages on 22nd June 1941. The immediate cause for these attacks was the war between Germany and Soviet Union. The events of late June will show themselves to be only a beginning of a numerous and determined partisan movement which will tie up many Axis troops in the years to come.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172257;Our allies, the Bulgarians, have been clamoring for more advanced armor, artillery, and anti-tank equipment to match the Red Army. We have an opportunity to send them some of our equipment, which we believe will fulfil their needs. what should we do? Historically, in July 1943, Germany finally agreed to modernize Bulgarian armored force (the 1st Armored Brigade) and supplied it with 46 PzKpfw IV tanks, 10 PzKpfW III tanks, 25 Stug III assault guns and 20 Sd Kfz 222 armored cars plus the necessary howitzers, anti-tank guns etc. In the end tanks ended up fighting its builder instead of the Red Army since Bulgaria switched sides in 1944.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172256;We have an opportunity to influence our potential allies, the Bulgarians. Their armored forces are mostly obsolete, and they have been clamoring for a chance to upgrade them. We are to send them three dozen of our Pz Kpfw 35(t) tanks. Foreign Ministry believes this will increase our prestige significantly. Historically, Germany provided Bulgaria with 36 Pz Kpfw 35(t) tanks in early February 1940. This shipment significantly influenced the eventual decision by Bulgaria to enter the Axis.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172255;We have successfully negotiated a sales deal with Yugoslavia, exchanging our Messerschmitt Bf-109 fighter technology for generous Yugoslav ore shipments, including shipments of valuable bauxite and chrome ore.

CEVTDESC_172241;Adolf Hitler outdid himself on Mussolini's state visit to Germany in September 1937. Sensing the Duce's frustration over Italy's treatment by England and feeling an actual kinship with the Italian Dictator, Hitler treated Mussolini to five days of parades, rallies, and official visits. Hitler would even grant a request of Mussolini's to view the ultra secret armament factories of Krupp Steel. Even downpours and guffaws by the German military wouldn't sour Mussolini's mood. In the largest international media event of the time, millions around the world would hear Mussolini and Hitler surprisingly declare that Fascism and National Socialism were equal political movements in the Olympic Stadium. While the international community knew the day would come for a fascist alliance, the magnitude of the event hung a cloud of inevitability of war over Europe. For morale purposes, England would not transmit the event.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172240;Benito Mussolini threatened to go to war with Germany if it proceeded with the imminent annexation of Austria in 1934. Strangely, this marked a major turning point in Italian politics that would come to Germany's advantage. France and England both failed to make good on their promises to support Italy and were seemingly willing to toss Italy to the wolves. Hitler backed down, and as the dust settled the Fascist Administration in Italy began to wonder why it was risking war for the seemingly impotent and scheming Western Powers. By 1937, Italy's international relations had done a 180 degree turn and German-Italian relations were at an all time high. Hitler took advantage of this by offering Mussolini a National Tour of his Third Reich.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_172220;As enemy forces rolled deeper into Germany, desperate plans were made for the Volksturm, a citizens militia, to be mobilized for defense all over the nation.

CEVTDESC_172170;After Italy's surrender in 1943, there remained pro-fascist Italian troops willing to continue the struggle on the side of Germany. Some 15,000 Italian volunteers spent a period of time training in the south of Germany, returning as the SS Legion Italia. Originally used in anti-partisan operations in February 1944, Himmler was reluctant to grant the unit full Waffen-SS status. But in 1944, when troops of the SS Legiona Italia distinguished themselves in action against the Allied landings at Anzio, Himmler proclaimed them full units of the SS. Later, the SS Legion Italia was granted full divisional status. Elements of the division lasted to the last days of the war, when having run out of ammunition, they unwisely surrendered to the partisans, who massacred the survivors to a man.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172169;With the invasion of the Soviet Union, the fascist regime in Italy was able to whip up a frenzy of support for the Axis, even, and especially, from the Catholic Church which blessed soldiers as they left for the 'Crusade Against the Godless East'. Even after sending an entire Army Corps as an expeditionary force to help the Germans, still thousands of Italians volunteered to join the Heer while Italy's own Armed Forces drastically needed the manpower.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172168;The rapid successes of the Wehrmacht had its price. Newly conquered nations were eager to prove to the German occupation forces that the war was not yet over. Attacks on outposts, sabotaged supply lines, and direct attacks on German units became common in the occupied territories. Even if partisan activity was not overtly damaging to the total war effort, these attacks had at least some impact on the supply lines of the German Army.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172167;On 11th November 1940, Schiff 16 (the raider ship Atlantis) encountered the British cargo ship Automedon. Shelling destroyed the bridge and killed the officers on the British ship, allowing the Germans to board and capture Top Secret mail for the High Command (Far East), new code tables, and a War Cabinet report on British forces, defenses of Singapore, information regarding Australia and New Zealand, and an appraisal of Japanese intentions. The documents, along with 10,000 tons of aviation fuel, were sent to Japan. Some believe these documents influenced the Japanese decision to go to war against the Allies.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_172162;Although the Soviet Navy has been primarily a defensive tool, Stalin has decided that he would like the ability to project power with naval forces built around modern battleships and large cruisers.  As a part of this change in policy, the Soviet ambassador has approached us with a proposal to trade our technical knowledge for resources from the Soviet Empire.

CEVTDESC_172129;As the Red Army was advancing from the east, the German occupying forces were perceived to be on the defensive in Poland. Polish Home Army (AK), directed by the Polish government-in-exile in London, was eager to prove that Poland still had its army and legal government. It was extremely important to counter Soviet attempts to install puppet governments, as well as gain support of UK and USA for post-war period. Warsaw uprising was part of the plan 'Burza' (Storm) - large operation of partisan units supporting advancing Red Army and installing local administration cells in liberated territories. At that point Germans had a comparatively small military presence in the Polish capital. The decision was based on assumption, that Red Army is so close to Warsaw that it will be able to join AK any day.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_172116;Bolivia was one of the most important producers of tin. In 1942, the Bolivian government decided to sell the tin to Germany at incredibly cheap prices. In exchange, German-sponsored missions helped Bolivia in developing the more remote lands and in improving industry and infrastructures.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172115;A few months after the German occupation the leader of the Danish Nazi party gave the Danish government an ultimatum. The government was to step back and the Nazi party was to take control of the country. If they refused, he threatened to expose the government for their betrayal of the Danish people. Clausen made this accusation thinking that the Germans would back him in his claims. They did not, and the democrats stayed in office. The Germans knew that backing Clausen would have caused too much dissent in Denmark.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172114;In 1943, new technology allowed British forces to contemplate a raid on the river dams of the Mohne and the Eder.

CEVTDESC_172108;After Denmark refused to hand over 12 torpedo boats to Germany, Germany decided to take them by force. At the same time, the German High Command decided that the Danish resistance had to be quelled, and thereby disarmed all branches of the Danish military. German soldiers soon attacked the naval base in Copenhagen. The Danes had little time to choose whether to scuttle the ships or to surrender. Germans also demanded the immediate disarmament of all branches of the Danish armed forces.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172107;As German soldiers began the attack on Holmen, the Danish Naval Command gave the order to scuttle all ships in harbor, or try to escape to Sweden.

CEVTDESC_172101;On 6th December 1940, the Vichy government ordered the arrest and indictment of ex-ministers and government leaders of the previous French state. The French people immediately demonstrated against the persecution of their former leaders, and the Vichy regime was faced with a decision.

This infuriated the German government, and many prominent leaders called for the immediate annexation of Vichy territory.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172092;Shortly after the declaration of war, Allied warships began intercepting any ships bound for German ports. Germany found increasingly that expected shipments were not arriving and this impacted their resource stockpiles considerably. Food shortages could only be avoided by importing vast quantities of foodstuffs via the Soviet rail system.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172091;We have shipped obsolete machine tools, steel pipes and other surplus items to the USSR in return for critical resources and foodstuffs. This has allowed us to reduce rationing constraints caused by the Allied blockade.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172090;Remembering the effects of the naval blockade during the First World War, the German leadership set out to ensure that they would be able to import critical resources and foodstuffs during the coming conflict. The Soviet economy was suffering badly from lack of tools, machinery and technical skills, and the Western democracies were unwilling to trade with the Communists. As part of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the Commercial Agreement was signed with the Soviet Union, increasing trade between the two countries almost ten-fold. At peak levels the USSR was providing over 85% of German imports.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172089;German coal exports to Italy were critical for the Italian economy. When Germany was blockaded shipments by sea were no longer possible and rail transport had to be used. Moving up to 12 million tons of coal every year placed an immense burden on the German transit system but we should assign as much transport as possible to help our Italian allies.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172084;German coal exports to Italy were critical for the Italian economy. In the pre-war years, 6 to 8 million tons of coal were sent by ship every year.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172083;Shortly after the loss of Wilhelm Gustloff, the ship Steuben left Baltiysk, Russia. Bound for Kiel in Germany, the ship carried 2500 wounded soldiers, 2000 refugees and a crew of 450.

CEVTDESC_172082;As Soviet forces pressed their advance in East Prussia, millions of German refugees were cut off. Admiral Donitz ordered the evacuation of Kreigsmarine servicemen and civilians from Gotenhafen using the great ship Wilhelm Gustloff.

CEVTDESC_172081;On 11th July 1936, German and Austrian officials met to hammer out an agreement. Germany stated that it would honor Austrian sovereignty, and showed a strong friendship between the Austrian and German governments. This served to ease some fears that a increasingly confident Germany would not respect international law and the sovereignty of other nations. However, all this had a secret agenda to provide amnesty for Austrian Nazis, lift censorship on Nazi media, allow the resumption of political activities by Austrian Nazis, and ensure the appointment of men friendly to the Nazis in the Schuschnigg cabinet.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_172077;On 30th January 1939, Hitler demanded the return of all former German colonies which had been distributed among several countries by the League of Nations in 1920. These demands were repeated publicly, and with rising war tension they became more threatening. The German demands were backed by Mussolini. Germans living in Memel and the Sudetenland kept hope for a full revision of the Versailles Treaty, as did many within conservative and rightwing groups.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172076;After the successful German invasion and occupation of the British Isles, the United States was faced with the choice of intervening. They had to choose whether or not to deliver an ultimatum to Hitler, demanding an immediate ceasefire on the British front and a German withdrawal from the British Isles. Bureaucratic elements had steadily lost support for the isolationist policy in the United States after the Battle of Britain, and popular opinion on the sovereignty and independence of the United Kingdom effectively forced the American government to issue the ultimatum to Hitler.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172075;On 6th May 1937, the German Zeppelin LZ-129 'Hindenburg' was destroyed in a tragic accident on the end of her flight from Frankfurt to Lakehurst. It was assumed that a spark from a mooring mast set the great airship on fire. Of the ninety-seven passengers and crew known to be aboard, only twelve passengers and thirty-seven crew members were saved. Germany's perfect record of safety had been shattered by this spectacular tragedy right in front of the assembled media and public. The commercial airship industry would never recover.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172074;In 1938, the German government promised the working class access to cheap automobiles if they bought special coupons.

Over three million visitors were in attendance, making it the first blockbuster exhibition.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172072;In 1938, the German propaganda ministry announced that the German minority in Czechoslovakia was subject to severe oppression in this country.

CEVTDESC_172070;In 1938, the recreational organization 'Kraft durch Freude' (Strength through Joy) started their new program to mass-motorize the German people. They issued special coupon cards that could be bought cheaply on a monthly basis. In this way, the average German worker could soon afford a brand-new Volkswagen automobile, when the total of 990 Reichsmarks worth of coupons had been purchased. Historically, however, the cheaply mass-produced cars were never delivered to the German customers. The money was used instead to build K¸belwagen armored cars in order to motorize the Wehrmacht.;;;;;;;;;;X

It was chosen as best film in the 1930s at both the Venice Film Festival and the Paris World Fair. In 1938, Leni Riefenstahl finished her latest project, a two part film named 'Olympia' on the Olympic Games in Berlin 1936. They were 'Olympia I - The Festival of the People' and 'Olympia II - The Festival of Beauty'. Many cameras and much equipment were needed to make the films. During the making, filming techniques and camera equipment developed rapidly. The films served as propaganda, as they focused on the German athletes as role models for the fascist physical ideal.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172067;From the thousands of works purged from the museums in spring, historically 650 were chosen for a special exhibit of Entartete Kunst. The exhibit traveled to eleven cities in Germany and Austria. In each installation, the works were poorly hung and surrounded by graffiti and hand written labels mocking the artists and their creations. Over three million visitors were in attendance, making it the first 'blockbuster' exhibition.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172066;Ever since the ruling Nazi party came to power in 1933, some artists in Germany had come to hard times. The works of famous artists like Kandinsky, Chagall, Kollwitz, Dix, Grosz or Feininger were considered 'degenerate' or 'Bolshevik'. In 1937, Nazi Party officials purged German museums of works they considered to be degenerate.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172065;The famous German actress and singer Marlene Dietrich (Der Blaue Engel) lived in America since the early 1930s working for Paramount Pictures. In 1936, the German government tried to win her back to star in propaganda movies by offering the incredible sum of 200,000 Reichsmarks per film. Dietrich declined. She became an American citizen in 1939, and later entertained American Forces at the front. She was awarded the Medal of Freedom for meeting a grueling schedule of performances under battle conditions despite risk to her life.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172064;In 1936, Germany violated stipulations of the treaty of Versailles set down at the end of the First World War. The treaty stated that no German military forces were allowed on the western side of the Rhine. When Hitler has troops march ostentatiously into this area, many nations were shocked. Some, such as France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, were forced to decide on a new policy to deal with this aggressive behavior. France went as far as to threaten Germany with war if the military forces were not immediately withdrawn.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172052;Germany was the most important export market for Swedish iron ore. Swedish companies committed to shipping 5000 tons of iron ore to Germany each year in return for German coal shipments that were critical to the economy. After war broke out, the British eventually raised objections to the trade, publicly arguing that it made Sweden complicit in the Axis war effort.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172051;Icelandic bases were strategically critical to the Battle of the Atlantic. With Denmark quickly falling to German aggression, Britain was forced to act swiftly to control the Icelandic region, or risk defeat in the Atlantic. British Marines landed in Reykjavik and seized strategic control of Iceland and Greenland. This was a serious setback for Germany in the Atlantic.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172050;When Fall Weserubung was put into effect, the German ambassador kindly informed Denmark that German troops were about to enter Denmark and seize control. The Danish position was rather hopeless, but they tried to avoid military disaster by submitting to the German will. When presented with the ultimatum, the Danish government ordered its Army to stand down and co-operate with advancing German forces.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172049;Operation Fall Weserubung consisted of plans to seize key airfields in Denmark and then to invade Norway. Germany sought to coup Denmark and then stage the Norwegian invasion from their bases. Some officers believed that Sweden should also be invaded, so that German could gain control of their rich ore fields.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172048;A few months after the outbreak of war between Germany and the Allies, the German transport ship Altmark entered Norwegian waters carrying approximately one-hundred British prisoners on board. In a small fjord off the Norwegian coast, the Altmark was intercepted by a Royal Navy taskforce. British forces boarded the German ship, and set the prisoners free. The nearby Norwegian navy was overmatched, and powerless to intervene. The Germans saw Norwegian neutrality as compromised and secretly decided to strike before they had a chance to join the Allies. The German plan to take Denmark and Norway was code-named Fall Weserubung.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172047;Pre-war Afghanistan and Germany were close friends. During the Berlin Olympics, the Afghan Field Hockey team was given the red carpet treatment, and several officers were actually sent to Germany to receive training while the Games were going on. Germany's Todt organization also worked on massive aid projects throughout Afghanistan. There was also a large rearmament program where the Italians and Germans helped Afghanistan begin modernization. Other nations to help included Czechoslovakia and the United Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172046;On 11th July 1936, German and Austrian officials met to hammer out an agreement. Germany stated that it would honor Austrian sovereignty, and showed a strong friendship between the Austrian and German governments. This served to ease some fears that an increasingly confident Germany would not respect international law and the sovereignty of other nations. However, all this had a secret agenda to provide amnesty for Austrian Nazis, lift censorship on Nazi media, allow the resumption of political activities by Austrian Nazis, and ensure the appointment of men friendly to the Nazis in the Schuschnigg cabinet.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172042;Germany put considerable weight into negotiations with Japan over the recognition of Manchukuo. The Japanese government offered considerable trade concessions, including strategic materials critical to German industry. Signing of the agreement meant the end to German trade with China.

CEVTDESC_172041;The German mission under von Falkenhausen immediately started training Chinese troops but progress was slow. By 1938, only 8 of the agreed 20 divisions were trained and there was increasing talk of war between China and Japan.

CEVTDESC_172039;The Germans provision of extensive military support to the Chinese did not go unnoticed.

CEVTDESC_172037;Germany maintained a strong economic mission in China under von Seeckt since 1934. In 1936, many in the German command believed the time had come to change the focus of German aid to China. As the Chinese Kuomintang was fighting against communism in the Far East, Germany provided railroad and manufacturing technology, uniforms, ammunition, armored scout cars, and many other military supplies to China. The new head of the German mission, Alexander von Falkenhausen, was very interested in helping in the struggle against the communists. He offered to organize the training of 20 Chinese divisions up to German standards. In return, Germany asked for tungsten and other strategic materials, none of which were of much use to Chinese industry. This increase in international involvement signaled Germany's resurgence in international politics.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172036;On 23rd October 1940, a historic meeting between Franco and Hitler took place in the French city of Hendaya, near the Spanish border. The purpose of the encounter, held in a armored wagon in the city train station, was to negotiate Spanish participation in World War Two alongside the Axis powers. Spain had previously solicited the rights to Gibraltar and all Moroccan territories, along with enormous industrial and economic help from Germany as payment for its participation. The final agreement ended up being only that Germany would receive the Spanish Blue Division, and to take control of some mines and weapon factories: Spain would otherwise stand apart from the war.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172035;Historically some 40,000 Spanish men served with Germany in an all-volunteer unit called the Blue Division.  However, these 'soldiers' sent by Franco had to be armed, trained and turned into a fighting force.  Serving on the Russo-German front, this unit allowed Franco to claim Spain was participating in the Fascist 'crusade' against Bolshevism, and also provided the diplomatic means to keep Germany out of Spanish affairs.  Germany would also gain control over Spanish wolfram mines.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172034;During the conflict in Spain, many German units and commanders fought for the Rebel cause, acquiring valuable experience with modern warfare in a real war. Unlike the other nations that were involved only to a minor degree in the conflict, Germany took advantage of this experience: it was widely studied by Wehrmacht commanders and its lessons proved invaluable to the further development of German military doctrine.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172033;At the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, Hitler sent some commanders as military advisors in charge of specific units to Spain, with the intention of testing the new tactical theories of the German army. In contrast with other countries, Germany got quite involved in the conflict and obtained important experience with modern warfare. Tons of weaponry were sent as well, along with the specifications needed to produce more. In particular, Nationalist Spain produced many Mauser Kar98 rifles, which became the standard rifle of the Spanish army. Providing all this help increased Hitler's influence over Spain and put Franco in debt with Germany.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172032;The desperation of Mussolini was an evident sign that fascist Italy was about to crumble and seek a separate peace with the Allies. Since the very first signs, the German High Command prepared plans to mobilize their troops in Italy to prevent the country from surrendering and to re-establish a fascist puppet government. During the night of 8th September 1943, as Field Marshal Badoglio, the new Italian prime minister, was signing a peace treaty with the Allies, German forces surrounded Rome and took over most of the northern provinces. Badoglio and the Royal family quickly fled to Allied territory while the Germans established a new puppet government in the controlled provinces. This was the Repubblica Sociale Italiana, under the nominal command of Mussolini, who was rescued from his imprisonment by German paratroopers.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_172017;After gaining absolute power, General Ion Antonescu sought to mimic Hitler's 'Night of the Long Knives' by eliminating his former comrades from the Iron Guard.  On 21st January 1941, the situation exploded and the Iron Guard created havoc for three days.  Implementing predetermined strategies, hordes of Iron Guard Legionnaires staged pogroms in many cities and villages.  Looting, torture and killing was common throughout the country.  Eventually, the rebellion was suppressed by the army.  In a telephone conversation on 22nd January, Hitler offered Antonescu the support of German troops in crushing the rebellion, but Antonescu declined.  After the rebellion was quelled, German troops helped smuggle a number of Legionnaires (including their leader Horia Sima) out of the country.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172016;Many in our government are enraged over the recent events in Yugoslavia. Having refused to stand with us, Yugoslavia will now learn that it cannot stand against us. We shall teach them a lesson they will never forget.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172015;Despite our extended offers of friendship and cooperation, the Yugoslav government has decided against us. Their entreaties of neutrality are meaningless, since we know they have been courting the Allies for some time now. The army has reported that they consider it important that we secure our southern flank, while the advantage lies on our side. Historically, Hitler flew into a rage upon learning of the Yugoslav coup and ordered an immediate attack on the country, even though this delayed his planned attack on the Soviet Union by a few crucial weeks.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172014;The unexpected coup against Regent Pavle and his government after massive expression of popular dislike towards the recently signed 'Pact of Steel' between our government and Yugoslavia has surprised most analysts. Seizing the opportunity, Croatian Ustashe nationalists have proclaimed the Independent State of Croatia in the west of Yugoslavia and are begging for our aid against the Yugoslav loyalists. Yugoslavia is quickly descending into a civil war. Most of our ministers believe that we should offer aid and formal alliance to Croatians, as they seem very enthusiastic in their support of our ideology. This would also allow us to crush the remnants of Yugoslavia quickly, which would allow us to move into Greece, our original objective.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_172013;Our military planners are in final stages of preparing for operation Barbarossa, the invasion of Soviet Union.

CEVTDESC_1400146;The terrible experience of being a soldier in the Red Army changed something in the minds of the young Russian men who fought in WW2. The war in Eastern front was terrible, and the Red Army's way of fighting made it even worse for the first line soldiers. Any morals and humanity they had vanished with their subhuman life and a certain death awaiting for them in each assault they made. They drunk all that they could find (no matter if it was toxic as long as it had alcohol, many deaths by intoxication were reported), sacked all that they could from conquered cities, raped German women and killed German civilians. They even killed some of their officers. By the end of the war, most soldiers in the front acted like they were part of a horde rather than an Army.;;;;;;;;;;X
CEVTDESC_1400143;Usually, spectacular parades were held in the Red Square in Moscow to celebrate victories or simply to raise Soviet people's morale.

The Parliament is wondering if we really understand the strategic importance of achieving the supremacy in the Mediterranean sea, or if its only a question of ineptitude of the commanders we sent to North Africa.

Most of the children are being sent out of London, people are trying to leave the cities to live in the country, and some people are even trying to get out of England to North Ireland or Scotland leaving their work behind. Several companies and factories have suffered a decrease in their productivity as a result of the low morale of their workers, and people aren't appearing during their shifts. We have to build a lot of new bomb shelters and protect with any means possible the vital points of our cities, and of course our monuments and symbols of identity.

CEVTDESC_1052015;The Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana (APRA), was a reformist political party founded in 1924 by Victor Ra˙l Haya de la Torre. The party advocated social reforms, the emancipation of indigenous peoples, improvement of agrarian conditions, and the socialization of some industries. Originally committed to revolutionary change, the party gradually became less radical. After being implicated in acts of political terror, the APRA was outlawed in 1931. While underground, the Apristas engaged in continual gun battles with the military, thus creating an enduring enmity between the two groups. President Prado Ugarteche tried to appear as a magnanimous and impartial man by freeing some APRA leaders, but keeping others in prison. During the 1945 elections, Prado Ugarteche supported candidate JosÈ Luis Bustamante, but in order to be elected he demanded the legalization of the APRA.;;;;;;;;;;X

His hold on power was short-lived, as the chief of Security, Luis Rizo, immediately killed RamÌrez. President Benavides returned that same evening to Lima and took control of the situation.

CEVTDESC_1052009;Ecuador was unprepared to meet the Peruvian invasion. The much larger Peruvian army of 13,000 men, supported by a battalion of armor, together with artillery and air support moved quickly into the southern coastal province of El Oro, threatening Guayaquil. The fewer than 1,800 Ecuadorian troops in the area lacked air cover and could offer only limited resistance. The Ecuadorian president's fear of being left unprotected from his political opponents led him to keep the nation's best fighting forces in Quito. Peruvian forces also moved into the disputed Amazonian territory without significant opposition. After a campaign lasting only three weeks, an armistice was arranged. The Rio Protocol of February 1942, awarded to Peru some 205,000 square kilometers of previously disputed Amazon territory.

CEVTDESC_1002058;On 14th December 1939, the Nobel prize for literature was awarded to the Finnish writer F.E. Sillanp‰‰. Later, he and several other Nobel Prize winners donated their gold medals to support Finland in the Winter War.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_1002038;Following the independence of Finland, the Finnish women's organizations created the so-called Lotta Organization. The goal of this organization was to recruit women that could perform work that was typically performed by men, thereby freeing up Finnish men for army duty.  In the early 1930s, the organization counted around 60,000 members, but by 1944 they had grown to include as many as 242,000 Finnish women. Almost 100,000 male workers were freed up from factory work by these women and almost half of these were sent directly to the front. Lotta women served in many areas including hospitals, offices, communications, plane spotting, radio operators and weather services.;;;;;;;;;;X

CEVTDESC_1002030;A few months after the German occupation the leader of the Danish Nazi party gave the Danish government an ultimatum. The government was to step back and the Nazi party was to take control of the country. If they refused, he threatened to expose the government's betrayal of the Danish people.

CEVTDESC_1002029;During the occupation King Christian X rode his horse through the streets of Copenhagen to signal to the people his resentment of the German occupation and thereby increased the dissent amongst the people.

CEVTDESC_1002028;Following the occupation of Denmark an agreement was forged between the Danish and German governments. As long as no hostile actions were taken against Danish interests by the Allies, Denmark was to keep its status as neutral in the war and no Danish units were to become involved offensively or defensively.

CEVTDESC_1002005;Germany has informed us that Allied forces are on the move to take the Swedish iron ore mines and cut off supply for Germany.

He tried an agreement with the agrarian party to establish a regime similar to Germany, but failed. In 1936, his credibility was almost gone, and for some time, he lived in Germany, but the German help and the course of the events made him perform an important role for Germany back in his country. He made contacts with the German Navy and on 14th December 1939, had a secret meeting with Hitler to analyze the possibility of a political coup in Norway. During the German invasion he presented himself on the national radio as the pro-Germanic commander of the conquered nation and told the army and population not to present armed resistance.

CAN_DESC;Canada saw a quick economic rise through the transcontinental railroad completed in 1890, shipping, industries, and settling in the West. The dominion supported Great Britain during the Boer War and World War One, underlining its semi-independent status by signing the Versailles Treaty for themselves in 1919 and by receiving its own seat in the League of Nations. Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King (1921 - 1930, 1935 - 1948) from the Liberals demanded for Canada the conduct of an independent foreign policy on the empire Conference 1923. With the Balfour Declaration on the Empire Conference 1926, Canada was granted independence and emancipation within the Commonwealth of Nations. The Westminster Statute 1931 released Canada as an independent state. The Great Depression hit Canada hard after a period of prosperity in the 1920s. The Conservatives rose to power (1930 - 1935) who followed Roosevelt's policy of the New Deal. In 1934 the Bank of Canada was founded.;;;;;;;;;;X

BUL_DESC;After the preliminary peace of San Stefano in the 8th Russian-Turkish War of 1877-78, the newly formed national state of Bulgaria included Macedonia to the Ochrid Lake and a coastal strip on the Aegean Sea. The Berlin Congress 1878, however, limited the country's territory to the region between Danube and Balkans. Macedonia and Eastern Rumelia remained with the Ottoman Empire. Russia, interested in controlling Bulgaria, watched the successes of Prince Alexander I (annexation of Eastern Rumelia in 1885 and the victory over Serbia in 1885-86) with distrust. They forced Alexander I to abdicate after a coup led by pro-Russian officers. His successor became Ferdinand of Saxony-Coburg-Gotha. He achieved the formal independence from the Ottomans and was crowned Czar in 1908. With the idea of a Greater Bulgaria as a vision the country became the driving force in the Balkans League and carried the main burden in the First Balkans War (1912-13). Bulgaria suffered defeat from a coalition of Greece, Serbia, Montenegro, Romania, and the Ottoman Empire during the Second Balkans War in 1913 in which Bulgaria had planned to devour parts of the Balkans now free from the Turks. In the peace of Bucharest, they lost large parts of the gains from the First Balkans War - Southern Dobrudja went to Romania, and Adrianople went to the Ottomans. Of Macedonia which Bulgaria had demanded as a whole they only managed to hold onto a small strip in the Pirin Mountains, the rest was parted between Serbia and Greece. In 1915 Bulgaria joined the Middle Powers and occupied the territories she sought to take for herself. After the Entente's victory the country lost its conquests in the Peace of Neuilly in 1919, plus the access to the Aegean Sea as Greece was awarded Southern Thrace. Ferdinand I abdicated in 1918 in favor of his son Boris III. Prime Minister Alexander Stambuliski (1919 - 1923), leader of the radical Farmers' Party, enacted a land reform and supported the Balkans Federation until he was killed in a military coup in 1923. After a Communist uprising that party was banned, Georgi Dimitrow went into exile in the Soviet Union.;;;;;;;;;;X

BRA_DESC;After slavery was abolished in 1888, the republicans gained much support from all parts of the Brazilian Empire. In 1889 the revolt began with a revolt of the military garrison and ended with the declaration of the Republic of Brazil. The 1891 constitution was patterned after the U.S. constitution, granting considerable autonomies to the respective provinces. Under the first elected presidents the domestic situation stabilized, but Brazil got into the cycle of economic crisis - Sugar Crisis of 1890, Coffee Crisis of 1896, end of the rubber boom in 1913. Meanwhile, Brazil's foreign minister, Baron Do Rio Branco extended the Brazilian territory through a series of treaties with British-Guyana, Columbia, Bolivia, Peru, and Uruguay, adding over 250,000 square miles to the country. Growing industries and a high influx of immigrants led to a strong industrial proletariat, changing the society of Brazil. The flourishing exports after World War One came to an end with the Great Depression of 1929-30, especially when the prices for coffee and rubber plummeted.

BOL_DESC;In foreign politics Bolivia suffered hurtful losses. A border conflict with Chile led to the Saltpeter War 1879 - 1883 which Bolivia lost despite an alliance with Peru. Having to cede the coastal province of Antofagasta in the peace treaty of Valparaiso in 1884, the country lost its access to the sea. In 1903 Brazil and Bolivia signed the Treaty of PÈtroplis, granting Brazil the important rubber province Acre. A sum of 2 million Pound Sterling didn't compensate the loss. Attempting to secure access to a port in the Chaco War with Paraguay (1932 - 1935) caused the loss of the larger part of the Chaco Boreal region, but at least secured access to the Paraguay river leading to the Atlantic Ocean (finalized in the Treaty of Buenos Aires 1938). Chaco War and the Great Depression brought an end to the positive economic development since 1895 when tin became main export good. In the face of protest movements of the middle class and the mine workers military governments with state socialist tendencies took over.;;;;;;;;;;X

BHU_DESC;In 17th century the Lama Ngawang Namgyal who had fled Tibet managed to unify the country and to secure his further conquests through the building of monastery fortresses (Dzongs). The first spiritual and secular ruler of Bhuatan, called Shabdung, helped the Drupka Sect to win and transferred the Tibetan governmental system of Dalai Lamas to Bhutan. The Drukpas (Druk = Dragon) gave the country its name - Dragon Land (Druk Yul). The succession of the ruler was based on reincarnation. Shabdung Namgyal supposedly separated the country into three regions which were ruled by princes (Penlop). In 19th century only two of the three houses were still of importance - the Tsonga-Penlops east of the Black Mountains under the Wangchuk family and the Paro-Penlops who governed almost all of western Bhutan. With the election of the Penlop of Tsonga, Ugyen Wangchuk, on 17th December 1907, as the first Druk Gyalpo (Dragon king) the Shabdung system was replaced by a hereditary monarchy. Externally, Bhutan came into conflict with the expanding British East India Company who drove the Bhutanese out of the Indian regions of Cooch Behar between 1772 and 1774. During 1864-65 Bhutan lost claims to parts of the Bengal and Siamese Plains in the Second British-Bhutanese War. In the Treaty of Punakha 1910 Bhutan formally became a British Protectorate but retained its internal autonomy.;;;;;;;;;;X

AUS_DESC;After World War One Austria had been reduced to its German core land. On 12th November 1918, the republic was proclaimed. The provisional national assembly created a preliminary constitution and appointed a coalition government under the social democrat Karl Renner (1919-20), replacing the previous majority vote system by a system of proportional representation, including suffrage for women. Goal of national assembly and government was the unification with Germany, made impossible, however, by decisions of the war's victors. A constitution declaring Austria a federal state was installed in 1920. In the election held thereafter, the social democrats lost to the conservative Christian Socialists who would become the dominating power in Austrian politics in the following years. Their governments, however, didn't succeed in stabilizing the young republic. Before the background of great economic problems the society drifted to the radical lefts (Republican Protection League) and rights (Heimwehr). Several times Austria was on the brink of civil war. A change of the constitution in 1929 to strengthen the role of the president was designed to further stabilize the country. In the early 1930s the Nazis gained support in Austria, too. Conservative Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuﬂ took the Nazi's successes as an opportunity to abolish the constitution and erect an authoritarian regime. After unrests in 1934 Dollfuﬂ banned all parties except his own Vaterl‰ndische Front and installed a constitution after fascist role models. He was killed, however, during a coup attempt on 25th July 1934. His successor, Karl Schuschnigg continued his policy, seeking to settle tensions with Germany and to protect Austria's sovereignty.;;;;;;;;;;X

AST_DESC;The Commonwealth of Australia was formally granted independence on 1st January 1901, joining the British Commonwealth and becoming a staunch ally of Britain. Its fortunes since that time have been mixed, while its economy has grown steadily since independence, it suffered heavy losses during the Great War, suffering the greatest casualties in proportion to total number of troops involved of any of the Allies during the war. Nevertheless, it was through the Great War that the ANZAC (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps) won a reputation for outstanding bravery surpassed by none, serving with distinction in Palestine and Flanders, while forever embedding the peninsula of Gallipoli in Australian folklore. The boom period of the 1920s ended with disaster as the Great Depression ruined Australia's economy and, at its worst, put up to a third of the country's workers out of a job. By 1936, the Australian economy is still suffering from the depression, and Australia is by no means ready for war. Yet, should war come, no one doubts they will continue to stand by Britain.;;;;;;;;;;X
AST_41_DESC;By December 1941, Australia has been at war for over two years, and Australians have fought first in Greece, then in Crete, and finally in North Africa alongside their Commonwealth allies, where the Anzacs are currently battling Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps. Yet, with the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7th December 1941, and the following Japanese push for expansion into the south Pacific, Australia seems to be in a difficult position. If the Japanese attacks are successful, the Australian mainland could be in danger for the first time in the war, and at the moment Japan's strike south is going very well, with the first obstacles being overcome on the Malayan peninsula and Britain's navy in the Far East effectively crippled with the loss of HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Repulse to Japanese bombers. Australia's critical hour appears to be upon her, and the question of withdrawing troops from North Africa to bolster the mainland's defense is thus being seriously considered.;;;;;;;;;;X

With the world at war again and a new generation ready to fight it, the question remains whether the Anzacs will continue to uphold their reputation as a fighting force equal to any in the world.;;;;;;;;;;X

ARG_DESC;In 1880 Argentina owned large areas suitable for their prime agricultural products: cattle and wheat. More workers were needed, increasing the number of immigrants. Financial capital, however, was largely controlled by the British who invested in infrastructure, controlled most banks and trade businesses, and that capital soon made Argentina the leading exporter of beef and wheat in the world. In the wake of this development an urban middle class formed as well as an industrial worker class. Both called for more representation in politics to be achieved through changes to the electoral system. The radical UCR (UniÛn Civica Radical), founded in 1889, fought for those goals and came strong out of the reform of the electoral system which the conservative president Roque S·enz Pena pushed through in 1912. In 1916 the first universal elections were held in which HipÛlito Irigoyen of the UCR won. For the first time the middle classes had political influence. In foreign politics Argentina steered a course of neutrality while social legislature was to take away some negative effects of the wave of industrialization in the country. The period of economic rise and the second presidency of Irigoyen was ended abruptly with the Great Depression of 1929-30. Conservative politicians and generals claimed the presidency after a military coup, but none of them could overcome the social tensions.;;;;;;;;;;X

ALL_F_MISSTACT;Killing all natives in a province will help in colonization attempts as will the presence of your own troops. The required 150-200 colonists that you will need to send will cost you somewhere between 15,000 and 20,000$ so make sure to build a solid economy by increasing infrastructure and trade levels and acquiring a monopoly in your center of trade. Remember the cheap traders will generate just as much wealth in a center of trade as the by far more expensive colonies! On the other hand tax incomes from the provinces where you build cities will be your most valuable asset. Watch out for inflation if you run across a gold mine ? inflation can only be reduced by going bankrupt...;;;;;;;;;;X

ALL_F_HISTDESC;The 2500$ you start with will last for a while but when its gone you'll need to have a decent economy in place not just low-level colonies. Try to establish one or preferably two cities early on by sending colonists there. Don't be afraid to take loans or even go bankrupt just keep in mind that the effects of a bankruptcy (higher interest rates for new loans lower troop morale) last for five years. Beware of natives!

ALB_DESC;In 15th century, Albanian national hero Skanderbeg fought back the Turkish invaders. After his death however and the fall of Krujas and Shkodra the country came under four centuries of foreign rule. Large numbers of the population converted to Islam in the 16th and 17th century, allowing them to rise into the highest offices - eleven Grand Veziers came from Albania, and Mohammed Ali founded a dynasty in Egypt 1805. The Islamization brought support for the resistance against Serbs and Greeks as well as against the Ottoman rule itself. Only at the end of the 19th century the national renaissance began with the founding of the League of Prizren. During the First Balkans War in 1912 the Albanian national congress in Vlore declared the country's independence which was accepted by the major powers in 1913 upon the condition that Wilhelms of Wied would be accepted as Prince. The short lived Principality of Albania was occupied by the Middle Powers during World War One before it was conquered by Italy. After the war the leader of the Democratic Party, Bishop Fan Noli, faced the ruling conservatives under Ahmed Zogu. After a democratic interlude in 1924, Zogu eventually prevailed with aid from Yugoslavia and White Guards from Russia. He became president in 1925 and proclaimed himself king in 1928.;;;;;;;;;;X

AFG_DESC;Afghanistan was always a troubled region for the British to maintain control of. An important part of the 'Great Game' between the British Empire and the Russian Czars during the 19th century, every attempt to fully subdue the country ran into fierce resistance. By 1880, however, after the Second Anglo-Afghan war, the emir of Afghanistan finally agreed to allow British control over the country's foreign affairs. But following the Great War, the Afghani emir was assassinated and his son launched yet another war against Britain until the war-weary British agreed to fully withdraw from the country. By 1921 a cease-fire was finally signed granting Afghanistan complete independence. By 1923, a constitution was drawn up and the long process of modernization began, perhaps a bit too quickly. The newly crowned King was deposed by a revolt from Afghani tribesman angry at his attempts to do away with centuries old traditions, forcing him into exile by the end of the 1920s. He was replaced by King Nadir Shah, who kept his continuing reforms to a more acceptable pace. By 1936, Nadir Shah has been assassinated and his son has inherited the throne, but despite lingering resentments among tribal leaders there is no sign of turmoil for the country in the immediate future.;;;;;;;;;;X
